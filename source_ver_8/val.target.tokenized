World wide , but close to elimination in the Americas and targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015 . In the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95 % , but is most often over 50 % . Reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections .
The greatest burden of HIV continues to fall on Sub-Saharan Africa , with 68 % of all people living with HIV and 72 % of all HIV-related deaths in 2009 . The epidemic in Africa is , however , heterogeneous , with high-prevalence generalized epidemics in Southern African countries ; generalized but moderate prevalence epidemics in Central , East and West Africa , and low-level epidemics in North Africa . No countries in Asia have a generalized epidemic .

WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 . Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds . Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999 , WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world . Since the introduction to northeast America , the virus has spread to most regions in North America , Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and several cases in South America .
By tick bite ; larval ticks are carried on migrating birds , which are refractory to the virus .

WHO estimates that 50,000 to 70,000 people are infected each year , with about 60 million people at risk in 36 countries . The chronic gambiense form in West and Central Africa accounts for 95 % of cases and is seperated from rhodesiense by the Great Rift Valley .
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa
Since the end of 2003 the A/H5N1 virus has spread globally , infecting poultry in over 60 countries and causing the loss of over 250 million poultry . In 2010 HPAI H5N1 remained entrenched in poultry in several Asian countries and Egypt .

The HTLV-1infected individual who tends to immunoactivation can develop HTLV-associated uveitis , polymyositis , inclusion body myositis , arthritis , pulmonary infiltrative pneumonitis , Sjogren syndrome and HAM/TSP .
Supportive with pain management .
Typically a cardiopulmonary infection as opposed to the primarily renal infection produced by Old World hantaviruses
The disease mainly affects the skin , peripheral nerves , mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes . Patients are classified as having either PL or ML . PL is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions . ML is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions .
Rodent -- rodent , with humans as accidental dead-end hosts . Infected reservoir hosts are asymptomatic and excrete infectious virus in the urine .
Tick-small mammals and birds-tick ; large mammals are necessary to maintain tick populations .
