World wide, but close to elimination in the Americas and targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015. In the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95%, but is most often over 50%. Reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections.
The greatest burden of HIV continues to fall on Sub-Saharan Africa, with 68% of all people living with HIV and 72% of all HIV-related deaths in 2009. The epidemic in Africa is, however, heterogeneous, with high-prevalence generalized epidemics in Southern African countries; generalized but moderate prevalence epidemics in Central, East and West Africa, and low-level epidemics in North Africa. No countries in Asia have a generalized epidemic.

Fish-eating mammals (including humans) shed C. sinensis eggs into the environment that are ingested by snails, where they develop into cercariae. The motile cercariae are released into water and infect freshwater fish and encyst in meat and skin as metacercariae
acute watery diarrhea, severe watery diarrhea with vomiting, leading to severe dehydration

Lice become infective 4–5 days after an infectious blood meal and remain so for life (20–30 days). Infected ticks remain infective for life (in excess of 10 years).
WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds. Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999, WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world. Since the introduction to northeast America, the virus has spread to most regions in North America, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and several cases in South America.
By tick bite; larval ticks are carried on migrating birds, which are refractory to the virus.
Unknown. bamboo rats may amplify infectious dispersal stages for human infections.
WHO recommends vaccination of all newborns. In countries where prevalence is low: WHO recommends vaccination of all newborns.
Combination of atovaquone and azithromycin for mild-to-moderate illness, clindamycin and quinine for severe disease.

Avoid tick bites, use repellent on skin and repellent or acaricide on clothing, check body daily for ticks after exposure, boil or pasteurize milk from cows, sheep, and goats in endemic areas.
WHO estimates that 50,000 to 70,000 people are infected each year, with about 60 million people at risk in 36 countries. The chronic gambiense form in West and Central Africa accounts for 95% of cases and is seperated from rhodesiense by the Great Rift Valley. 
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa
Since the end of 2003 the A/H5N1 virus has spread globally, infecting poultry in over 60 countries and causing the loss of over 250 million poultry. In 2010 HPAI H5N1 remained entrenched in poultry in several Asian countries and Egypt. 
By tick bite, blood transfusion; bone marrow for transplantation is routinely screened
Wild rodents (gerbils)
Sudden onset of high fever, headache, chills, vomiting, myalgias, photophobia and dysthesias
Valley fever, San Joaquin fever, Desert fever, Desert rheumatism, California disease.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, Four Corners disease.
The mites are infected by feeding on reservoir animals (small rodents), and maintain the infection throughout their life stages.
The HTLV-1infected individual who tends to immunoactivation can develop HTLV-associated uveitis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, arthritis, pulmonary infiltrative pneumonitis, Sjogren syndrome and HAM/TSP.
Supportive with pain management.
Typically a cardiopulmonary infection as opposed to the primarily renal infection produced by Old World hantaviruses
The disease mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes. Patients are classified as having either PL or ML. PL is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions. ML is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions.
Rodent–rodent, with humans as accidental dead-end hosts. Infected reservoir hosts are asymptomatic and excrete infectious virus in the urine.
Tick-small mammals and birds-tick; large mammals are necessary to maintain tick populations.
Brucella melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis

Rodent to rodent with spill over to humans in case of adequate exposure.
Cat liver fluke disease, foodborne trematodiasis

Mainly humans; rarely domestic animals
Human.
Systemic treatment to prevent dissemination with pentavalent antimonials.
Microscopy of stained thick blood smears; membrane filtration; PCR
Prevent intimate contact with cases and contamination of environment from lesions.

LACV is the primary cause of arboviral encephalitis in children in the USA.  JCV is most commonly found around the Great Lakes in USA and Canada. 
Fox–rodent–fox (sylvatic cycle).
Mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito. There is an enzootic cycle, mainly between C. taralsis and passerine birds. There is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits. Viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds. Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days.
