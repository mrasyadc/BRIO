World wide, but close to elimination in the Americas and targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015. In the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95%, but is most often over 50%. Reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections. CRS is also grossly underreported. For example, it is estimated that over 45,000 CRS cases occur annually in Southeast Asia yet only an average of 13 CRS cases per year were reported to WHO between 2000 and 2009. Rubella is a public health concern because of CRS and in 1996 it was estimated that 110,000 CRS cases occurred annually in developing countries. Paradoxically, a poor rubella immunization program may actually increase the incidence of CRS if the burden of illness is shifted to young adults, where pregnancy is common. Therefore rubella immunization programs must achieve and maintain high immunization rates ( > 80%) or be supplemented by the immunization of women of childbearing age. In 2009 two-thirds of countries included a rubella containing vaccine in their national immunization schedule yet in many developing countries rubella vaccine has not been included because of lack of information on the burden of CRS, costs, and concerns about causing a paradoxical increase in CRS cases.
HIV was first recognized clinically in 1981. As of 2009, over 25 million people are estimated to have died from HIV and around 33 million people are living with HIV. HIV epidemics are categorized into ‘low-level’ (HIV prevalence <1% in the general population and <5% in vulnerable group such as MSM, injecting drug users, sex workers); ‘concentrated’ (HIV prevalence <1% in the general population but > 5% in at least one vulnerable group); and ‘generalized’ (HIV prevalence > 1% in the general population). The greatest burden of HIV continues to fall on Sub-Saharan Africa, with 68% of all people living with HIV and 72% of all HIV-related deaths in 2009. The epidemic in Africa is, however, heterogeneous, with high-prevalence generalized epidemics in Southern African countries; generalized but moderate prevalence epidemics in Central, East and West Africa, and low-level epidemics in North Africa. No countries in Asia have a generalized epidemic. HIV-1 can be divided in four groups (M, O, N, and P). Over 90% of HIV-1 infections are group M and the map opposite shows the distribution of the 9 subtypes (clades) and recombinants of the M group HIV-1 viruses.
For W. bancrofti: Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles spp., and Aedes spp. in the Pacific Islands; for B. malayi: Mansonia, Anopheles, and Aedes; for B. timori, An. barbirostris. Anopheles spp. transmit parasites less efficiently than Culex spp., and Culex spp. are more abundant in urban settings.
Pestis, pest, bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, black plague, black death.
Fish-eating mammals (including humans) shed C. sinensis eggs into the environment that are ingested by snails, where they develop into cercariae. The motile cercariae are released into water and infect freshwater fish and encyst in meat and skin as metacercariae. When ingested by mammals, the metacercariae migrate into the bile ducts where they develop into adult flukes that produce and excrete eggs into feces. The cycle takes approximately 3 months.
Among those infected, about 20% develop acute watery diarrhea, of which 10–20% develop severe watery diarrhea with vomiting, leading to severe dehydration which may be lethal if not treated. The CFR is typically below 5%, but in crowded refugee camps it can run as high as 50%.
The blood-feeding nematodes Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). A. ceylanicum has a limited distribution. The adult nematodes are up to 10mm long.
Lice become infective 4–5 days after an infectious blood meal and remain so for life (20–30 days). Infected ticks remain infective for life (in excess of 10 years).
WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds. Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999, WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world. Since the introduction to northeast America, the virus has spread to most regions in North America, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and several cases in South America. The national average annual incidence of neuroinvasive disease in the USA during 1999 to 2008 was 0.40 per 100,000 population (range: 0.01–1.02). In that time period in the USA, 28,961 cases were confirmed, including 1,131 deaths. Neuroinvasive disease incidence is higher among males, especially among persons aged 60 years. The highest incidence of neuroinvasive disease occurredin theWest Central and Mountain regions, probably resulting from the high efficiency of Cx. tarsalis as both an epizootic and epidemic WNV vector in those areas. Most US cases occur in the late summer, when Culex mosquitoes are more active and after WNV amplification in the bird reservoir. In warm climates year-round transmission is seen.
By tick bite; larval ticks are carried on migrating birds, which are refractory to the virus. The virus is also spread among veterinarians, farmers, shepherds, butchers, and slaughter-house workers by contact with the blood of infected livestock. Person-to-person spread is by contact with infectious body fluids of patients.
Unknown. It has been proposed that bamboo rats may amplify infectious dispersal stages for human infections.
WHO recommends vaccination of all newborns. In countries where prevalence is low: WHO recommends vaccination of all newborns.
Combination of atovaquone and azithromycin for mild-to-moderate illness, clindamycin and quinine for severe disease. Exchange transfusion for life-threatening infection, dialysis in case of renal failure. Chloroquine is ineffective.
Enteric fever, typhus abdominalis.
Avoid tick bites, use repellent on skin and repellent or acaricide on clothing, check body daily for ticks after exposure, boil or pasteurize milk from cows, sheep, and goats in endemic areas. An inactivated vaccine is available. Specific hyperimmune globulin used in the past as prophylaxis after tick-bite may worsen the disease.
WHO estimates that 50,000 to 70,000 people are infected each year, with about 60 million people at risk in 36 countries. The disease distribution is limited by the range of the tsetse fly vector. Cases outside the tsetse fly distribution are likely imported. The disease distribution is patchy, with discrete foci and little to no disease between these foci. It is a disease of poverty and mainly occurs in remote rural areas. African trypanosomiasis was close to eradication through a variety of control programs, a loosening of these control programs caused the disease to reemerge in the 1980s. However, recent disease control programs are reversing this trend. The chronic gambiense form in West and Central Africa accounts for 95% of cases and is seperated from rhodesiense by the Great Rift Valley. Uganda is the sole country reporting both forms, with rhodesiense in the south and gambiense in the northwest.
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa, where it is estimated that 12–13 million humans are infected. The prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age, and is more common in men as they are more exposed. Loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control. It has been proposed that areas where the Loiasis prevalence is > 20%, are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment.
Since the end of 2003 the A/H5N1 virus has spread globally, infecting poultry in over 60 countries and causing the loss of over 250 million poultry. In 2010 HPAI H5N1 remained entrenched in poultry in several Asian countries and Egypt. While migratory waterfowl plays a role in the long-distance spread of H5N1 (see Bird Migration map), the intensification of poultry farming and poorly regulated movement and trade in poultry is probably the most important factor in sustaining the current epizootic. HPAI H5N1 is highly contagious between birds and has a high fatality in most poultry species, making it an economically important disease. However, it is the risk to humans that has driven most of the control activities. Over 500 human cases have been detected in 15 countries. The concern remains that H5N1 may evolve or reassort with another influenza A virus to become either more transmissible from poultry to humans or transmissible from person to person.
By tick bite, blood transfusion; bone marrow for transplantation is routinely screened in endemic areas.
Wild rodents (gerbils) that live in burrows together with sandfly vector. Hyraxes for L. aethiopica.

The mites are infected by feeding on reservoir animals (small rodents), and maintain the infection throughout their life stages. The infection is passed on by transovarial transmission. O. tsutsugamushi are present in the salivary glands of the larvae and injected into the host during feeding.
The most prevalent HTLV-1 clinical manifestations can be divided into those associated with ATL (immunosuppression) or associated with HAM/TSP (immunoactivation). The HTLV-1-infected individual who immunologically tends to immunosuppression can develop opportunistic infections such as Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection, recurrent skin infections and ATL. The HTLV-1infected individual who tends to immunoactivation can develop HTLV-associated uveitis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, arthritis, pulmonary infiltrative pneumonitis, Sjogren syndrome and HAM/TSP.
Supportive with pain management.
Typically a cardiopulmonary infection as opposed to the primarily renal infection produced by Old World hantaviruses; renal involvement and hemorrhage are rare in NewWorld cases. Symptoms are fever, myalgia, and GI pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension, with rapid progression to respiratory failure and shock. Convalescence is prolonged. CFR is 35–60%.
The disease mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes, shown by patches of pigmented or reddish skin with loss of sensation, peripheral nerve enlargement with loss of sensation, sometimes paralysis, muscle wasting and trophic ulcers. Patients are classified as having either PL or ML. PL is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions. ML is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions. Skin lesions are often symmetric. Involvement of the nasal mucosa results in nasal congestion and epistaxis. Reduced sensation of digits may lead to their loss due to trauma. Up to 10% of cases with early lesions may resolve spontaneously.

Human–mosquito–human around housing; monkey–mosquito–monkey and monkey–mosquito–human in the forests of West Africa and Malaysia. Human viremia lasts 3–5 days since onset of symptoms; the mosquito can transmit 8–12 days after taking a viremic blood meal, depending on the ambient temperature.
Mainly humans; rarely domestic animals. Humans can be short-term carriers after an infection (10%) or become chronic carriers in the biliary tract (1–5%), shedding viable bacteria in the stool. Chronic carriers are mainly adults with pre-existingbiliary tractpathology.Urinary carriagemay occur in areas where Schistosoma haematobium is endemic.
Human.

Microscopy of stained thick blood smears taken around noon; membrane filtration; PCR. Eosinophilia and high IgE levels are indicators of active infection.
Prevent intimate contact with cases and contamination of environment from lesions. Lesions or discharge from the lesions are infectious. Treat close contacts. There has been a drastic decline in global disease prevalence since mass treatment campaigns with penicillin under the technical guidance ofWHO and with material support from UNICEF in the 1950s and 1960s.

High altitude rodents, including ground squirrels and porcupines; ticks by trans-stadial transmission; possibly transovarial, but this is considered unlikely.
The California group viruses are widely distributed over all types of terrain. Each has its preferred vector mosquito species and host, for instance snowshoe hare for SSHV. LACV is the primary cause of arboviral encephalitis in children in the USA. Most LACV infections occur in those residing close to woodland breeding sites of Ae. triseriatusfrom July to September. Boys are more often affected with LACV, as they more often play in the woods. JCV is most commonly found around the Great Lakes in USA and Canada. The JCV vectors prefer hilly woodlands where they breed in ponds from April to June. SSHV, has a different ecosystem: (sub) arctic forests and tundras in Canada and Siberia. SSHV has been detected in China. SSHV transmission occurs during the arctic summer from May to August, and mainly affects children (<10 years), especially boys. Lumbo virus is a strain of TAHV isolated from mosquitoes in Mozambique (Africa), but no human cases have been diagnosed there.
Fox–rodent–fox (sylvatic cycle). Foxes are the definitive hosts of the adult worm. Eggs are excreted with the feces and ingested by humans or the intermediate rodent host, where they hatch. The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and via the blood they reach the liver, lungs, brain, and heart. There they form metacestodes in which protoscolices develop. When the rodent is eaten by the definitive host, these attach to the small intestine and grow into adult worms. Occasionally wild carnivores (e.g. coyotes or wolves) can be definitive hosts. In some rural areas there is a synanthropic cycle in which dogs or cats are definitive hosts, acquiring the parasite from wild rodents.
Mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito. There is an enzootic cycle, mainly between C. taralsis and passerine birds. There is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits. Viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds. Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days. Humans and horses are dead-end hosts for WEEV because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes.
Ancylostomiasis, Necatoriasis, Uncinariasis, ground itch.
Immunization with tetanus toxoid (inactivated tetanus toxin). Immunization of pregnant women protects infants from neonatal tetanus.
Tabanid adult female flies, mainly Chrysops silacea, C. dimidiata, and C. distinctipennis. These day-biting and bloodsucking flies breed in forested and damp environments (e.g. swamps or rotten vegetation). Other favorable environments are cocoa plantations. Chrysops are attracted by movement, dark objects, and smoke. The vector does not enter structures like homes or barns. Up to 18% of the vector population can be infected with L. loa in endemic areas.
The dimorphic fungi: Histoplasma capsulatum (worldwide) and H. capsulatum var. duboisii (Africa). The fungi grow as a mycelium in the soil at ambient temperatures and convert to the yeast form in the lung at body temperature.
Direct transmission via skin to skin or oral contact (also via sharing drinking and eating utensils). Sharing of drinking vessels plays an important role in transmission of endemic syphilis in arid regions. There is little or no mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy.
Bilharziasis, snail fever, Katayama fever or syndrome, intestinal schistosomiasis.
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. Antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign, or misdiagnosed and underreported. Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. Cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern Brazil and north Iran. This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. In Southeast Asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water. In northeast Thailand, 20% of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis, which accounts for 39% of fatal septicemias and 36% of fatal community-acquired pneumonias. Up to 80% of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal disease, or alcoholism, age, chronic infection, or immunosuppressive therapy. Sporadic human infections with glanders (B. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.
