Animal -- mosquito -- animal with spillover to humans in epidemics via direct/indirect contact to infected animal tissue or mosquito bite .
The vector defecates during feeding , and the infected feces are rubbed into the bite wound or conjunctivae , mucousmembranes , or abraded skin ; blood transfusion , organ transplant and shared needles . Congenital infection occurs in 2 -- 8 % of infected pregnancies . Oral transmission occurs by eating or drinking contaminated food or drink .
N. meningitidis is transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets .
HBV disease has an acute and chronic form . 10 % of children and 30 -- 50 % of adults present with symptoms of acute HBV infection similar to hepatitis A and last several weeks : fatigue , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , myalgia , jaundice , dark urine , and light stools . Fever is often absent and arthritis and rash may be present . Chronic disease evolves to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma and eventually death . 90 % of infants who are infected in their first year develop chronic infection . Only 10 % of adults who acquire infection develop chronic disease , as the majority is able to clear HBV within 6 months . Differences in disease severity , risk of liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma are seen by age of infection , level of viral replication , level of inflammation , region and HBV genotype . Also co-infection with HDV leads to more severe chronic liver disease .
Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 -LRB- HTLV-1 -RRB- , a type C retrovirus with at least 6 subtypes . The virus was isolated for the first time in the USA in 1980 , before HIV-1 -LRB- also a retrovirus -RRB- was discovered in 1983 . Genomically , simian T-lymphotropic virus -LRB- STLV -RRB- isolates cluster closely with HTLV-1 in the same region , suggesting simian-to-human transmission at multiple occasions .

For mild cases , an oral triazole ; for severe cases , amphotericin B followed by an oral triazole for at least a year .
Microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito , and develop in 2 weeks into larvae that enter the mouth-parts . Larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed . In humans , they travel via thelymphatics , when adults they form ` nests ' and produce microfilariae , which migrate to the blood and display periodicity coinciding with the peak vector biting times .

Common unspecific symptoms are acute febrile illness with chills , sweats , nausea , headache , and vomiting ; high fever with chills is more common in P. vivax than in P. falciparum malaria . Recent reports provide evidence that vivax malaria is not as benign as previously thought . P. vivax can lead to severe anemia , acute respiratory distress , liver failure , renal failure , and even cerebral malaria .
Aquatic insects ; in southern Australia mosquitoes ; not yet fully understood .
Hookworm eggs hatch in the soil and develop to infective larvae -LRB- L3 -RRB- that can penetrate the skin . After entering the host , the larvae migrate to the lungs , move up the trachea and swallowed . In the gastrointestinal tract the larvae mature to adult worms -LRB- both sexes -RRB- . After mating , the female hookworms produce up to 30,000 eggs per day that are shedded with the stools into the environment .
Loiasis is not as severe as other filarial diseases . Typical finding is transient subcutaneous swellings -LRB- Calabar swellings -RRB- which are angiedemas . These swellings are itchy and mainly occur on the limbs , especially forearms and when close to joints may restrict movement . Less frequently : giant urticaria , arthritis , and fever . The adult worm sometimes migrates across the subconjunctiva of the eye . Encephalopathic reactions may occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns to control onchocerciasis . These SAEs mainly occur in those with heavy infection -LRB- > 30,000 microfilariae per ml blood -RRB- .

SARS presents initially with fever , headache , myalgia , and a non-productive cough that may progress to dyspnoea with pulmonary infiltrations on chest x-ray . Gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present in early SARS illness . Case fatality is around 10 % , and is higher in older adults than in children and young adults .
Ingestion of tapeworm eggs from feces of foxes , dogs , and cats or contaminated fomites . There is no person-to-person transmission .

Deer , ruminants , and field rodents -LRB- A. phagocytophilum -RRB- ; unknown for N. sennetsu ; other members of the genus parasitize the trematode worms of aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates .
Mainly humans . In Southeast Asia , monkeys , wild carnivores , dogs , and cats may also be infected with B. malayi . W. bancrofti has no known reservoir host .
The mosquito becomes infected with MAYV during feeding on a viremic host . The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the mosquito . After a few days , depending on the ambient temperature , the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding .
Serology -LRB- IFA on acute and convalescent serum -RRB- ; cross-reactivity occurs . Microscopy of blood or bone marrow smears is insensitive ; PCR on acute phase whole blood ; isolation by cell culture in reference labs .
Hendra virus : pteropid bats are the primary reservoir of Hendra virus and are asymptomatic . The viruses can be isolated from their reproductive tracts and urine . The epidemiological reasons for the emergence of Hendra virus infection in horses are not clear . All human cases had close contact with infected horses . Nipah virus outbreaks have occurred only in South Asia and may be associated with the bat-breeding season . In Malaysia , it was hypothesized that the bats fed on fruit trees in pig farms , and that fallen fruit contaminated with bat saliva containing Nipah virus was eaten by pigs , who became infected . Nipah viruses have been isolated from bats in Cambodia and Thailand , and a high seroprevalence has been found in fruit bats in NW India , in the absence of reported pig or human disease . In Bangladesh , there is epidemiologic evidence of bat -- human transmission without an intermediate livestock host , and of human -- human transmission . Young boys who gather fruit from the trees are at higher risk of disease . Also drinking palm sap from trees is a potential risk factor . Antibodies to henipaviruses have been found in fruit bats in Madagascar -LRB- Pteropus and Eidolon sp . -RRB- and in Ghana -LRB- Eidolon sp . -RRB- , but in the absence of virus isolation or RNA detection , it is not possible to know which virus is involved . No human or animal cases have been reported in Madagascar or in Africa .

The principal clinical feature of tetanus is painful skeletal muscle spasms and rigidity . Three clinical forms are recognized . The commonest is generalized tetanus , which usually begins with spasms of the facial muscles and spreads in a descending pattern . On presentation patients commonly have ` lockjaw ' -LRB- trismus -RRB- , neck stiffness , difficulty swallowing , and abdominal rigidity . Generalized spasms may result in an arched posture -LRB- opisthotonus -RRB- . Other symptoms include elevated temperature , blood pressure , and sweating . Localized tetanus presents as localized spasms of muscles around the entry wound . Cephalic tetanus is rare and results from infection in the head and neck , and affects cranial nerves .
Primary : BCG vaccination of children protects against disseminated disease . Secondary : intensive search for and treatment of source cases ; contact investigation and treatment of positive cases with chemoprophylaxis .
