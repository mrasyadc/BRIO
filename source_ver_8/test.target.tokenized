For mild cases , an oral triazole ; for severe cases , amphotericin B followed by an oral triazole for at least a year .
Microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito . Larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed . In humans , they travel via thelymphatics , when adults they form ` nests ' and produce microfilariae
South American blastomycosis , Brazilian blastomycosis , Lutz -- Splendore -- Almeida disease .
Microscopic identification of eggs in the stool
Access to clean water and sanitation ; protective clothing for occupational risk ; after accidental exposure , dry the skin and apply 70 % alcohol ;
High fever , conjunctivitis , coryza , cough , maculopapular rash beginning on the face , spreading downwards to reach the hands and feet . Characteristic small white spots -LRB- Koplik spots -RRB- on the buccal mucosa . Complications may consist of otitis media , pneumonia , laryngotracheal bronchitis -LRB- croup -RRB- , blindness , severe skin infections , severe diarrhea and encephalitis , sometimes fatal .
Bartonella quintana
Fever , cough , hemoptysis , and pleuritic chest pain .
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control , disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas .
Hendra virus : manage contact between fruit bats and horse by basic husbandry measures such as placing food and water points under cover , regulate movement of horses from areas where the disease is occurring , regulate import of horses from Australia during outbreaks . Nipah virus : avoid contact with fruit bats and their discharges ;
Hendra virus : encephalitis and pneumonia , with a rapid progression to death -LRB- few survive -RRB- .
RT-PCR on whole blood or serum ; virus isolation ; plaque reduction neutralization test -LRB- there is crossreactivity with related viruses , including CHIKV -RRB- .
Supportive .
revaccination is recommended every 10 years . Anti-mosquito precautions . Prevent infected individuals from mosquito exposure to break the transmission cycle .
Common unspecific symptoms are acute febrile illness with chills , sweats , nausea , headache , and vomiting . P. vivax can lead to severe anemia , acute respiratory distress , liver failure , renal failure , and even cerebral malaria .
Aquatic insects ;
Hookworm eggs hatch in the soil and develop to infective larvae -LRB- L3 -RRB- that can penetrate the skin . After mating , the female hookworms produce up to 30,000 eggs per day that are shedded with the stools into the environment .
Typical finding is transient subcutaneous swellings -LRB- Calabar swellings -RRB- which are angiedemas . These swellings are itchy and mainly occur on the limbs
Clostridium tetani
Control deer population ; avoid areas with ticks ; tick bite precautions : cover skin , repellent on skin and clothing
None .
Cattle with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy .
Direct fecal -- oral transmission and via contaminated surfaces .
Lice infestation -LRB- pediculosis -RRB- can be controlled by treating clothes and bedding with insecticides or boiling -LRB- bedding at shelters is a major source of lice infestation -RRB- .
Monkeys
Bite of infected larval mites -LRB- chiggers -RRB- .
SARS presents initially with fever , headache , myalgia , and a non-productive cough that may progress to dyspnoea with pulmonary infiltrations on chest x-ray .
Ingestion of tapeworm eggs from feces of foxes , dogs , and cats or contaminated fomites .
Infected individuals shed bacteria into environment , contaminating water and food products
Hemorrhagic fever , jungle yellow fever , urban yellow fever .

Deer and dogs -LRB- E. chaffeensis , E. ewingii -RRB- . The whitetailed deer . Deer , ruminants , and field rodents -LRB- A. phagocytophilum -RRB- ;
Mainly humans .
The mosquito becomes infected with MAYV during feeding on a viremic host . The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the mosquito . After a few days , depending on the ambient temperature , the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding .
Serology ; PCR on acute phase whole blood ; isolation by cell culture in reference labs .
Hendra virus : pteropid bats are the primary reservoir of Hendra virus and are asymptomatic .
