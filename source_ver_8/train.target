In total over 8,000 cases and almost 800 deaths were recorded and, remarkably, much of the global transmission of SARS can be traced to a single individual who disseminated infection at a hotel in Hong Kong.

nocturnal fever, cough, myalgia, headache, and abdominal pain. S. japonicum causes intestinal schistosomiasis with: diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood in the stool, hepatosplenomegaly. Chronic infection leads to liver fibrosis and portal hypertension, anemia, and altered growth and cognitive development in infected children
By tick bites, ingestion of uncooked, parasitized aquatic hosts
About 90% of the cases in a recent outbreak in Turkey were farmers. CCHFV genotypes cluster geographically, with exceptions: the Asia 1 genotype has been found in Madagascar, where it was possibly introduced by migrating birds, and Africa 1 in the Middle East, which may have been introduced with infected livestock.
PCR is able to distinguish between these species; stool antigen tests can identify E. histolytica.
An estimated 650 million people are at risk in 10 provinces of China. Eating raw frogs also lead to human infections in China, and the USA. Consumption of lizards caused several cases in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and India.

The global dengue distribution follows vector presence and introduction of the virus, and occurs basically between the 10 C isotherms.
The name of the agent informs us where the agent was initially found, but most agents have a more widespread distribution.
ONNV is a mutant of CHIKV that appeared in 1959 in Uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of Africa, leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic. There was a small outbreak in Côte d’Ivoire in 1984–1985 and again in 2003, also described as Igbo-Ora virus and a small recurrence in Uganda in 1996. Serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in Kenya in 1994–1995 and in horses in Nigeria, but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with CHIKV antibody. 
Fleas
Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne diseasein both North America and Europe. Incidence is seasonal, corresponding to increased vector activity during summer. Climate change, more housing in wooded areas, and expanding populations of deer, and small rodents may be responsible for the increase in Lyme disease cases.

Rabies occurs in more than 150 countries and territories; world wide, more than 55,000 people die of rabies every year; Most cases of rabies in North America and Australia have been acquired from bats, often with no documented record of a bite. The USA was declared free of canine rabies transmission in 2007. In the Americas, dog rabies control reduced human cases to 16 by 2009.
In the UK, the primary epidemic has been associated with dietary exposure to BSE-infected bovine material during the BSE epidemic in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, before effective controls to prevent the BSE agent entering the human food supply were put into place. Most people who have developed vCJD have lived in or visited the UK during this time period.

Eggs hatch in water and release miracidia larvae that penetrate the snail. the larvae pass through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity, enter the liver, and lay eggs in the bile duct, which are then excreted in the feces.
There are three transmission cycles: (1) sylvatic or jungle, (2) intermediate or savannah, and (3) urban.

Bartonellosis due to B. bacilliformis was originally restricted to high, dry mountain valleys from 600 to 3,200 meters in the Andes of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In endemic areas attack rates of 12.7/100 person-years are found, with highest rates in children under 5.

Not completely understood: moist environments close to waterways, in forest or under flooring, also sandy and acidic soil and rotten vegetation.
Ribavirin may limit the severity and improve the prognosis of LACV infections.
Leprosy control is achieved by timely detection and treatment of new cases. BCG vaccination provides variable protection: from 34% to 80%.
After ingestion, the virus infects hepatocytes, resulting in periportal necrosis. The virus is shed via bile into the stool and contaminates the environment, leading to new infections in susceptible exposed individuals.
