Immunization with tetanus toxoid (inactivated tetanus toxin). Immunization of pregnant women protects infants from neonatal tetanus.
Hib is a common invasive bacterial infection that primarily causes pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia. Pneumonia due to Hib is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of bacterial pneumonia. Hib meningitis may present acutely or subacutely with fever, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and a bulging fontanelle in infants or a stiff neck in older children. Bacteremia may be present with meningitis or pneumonia but may also occur without an obvious focus of infection. Hib may also cause epiglottitis, which presents with fever, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing, talking and breathing. Infections of soft tissue, bones, and joints with H. influenzae may occur.
Acute irregular fever, chills, sweating, arthralgia, headache, and depression. Evidence of localized suppurative infections may be found in liver, spleen, genitourinary tract, and osteo-articular (joints and sacrum). Symptoms may last for months and vary from mild to severe and even fatal (CFR: <2%).
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. Antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign, or misdiagnosed and underreported. Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. Cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern Brazil and north Iran. This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. In Southeast Asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water. In northeast Thailand, 20% of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis, which accounts for 39% of fatal septicemias and 36% of fatal community-acquired pneumonias. Up to 80% of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal disease, or alcoholism, age, chronic infection, or immunosuppressive therapy. Sporadic human infections with glanders (B. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa, where it is estimated that 12–13 million humans are infected. The prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age, and is more common in men as they are more exposed. Loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control. It has been proposed that areas where the Loiasis prevalence is > 20%, are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, Four Corners disease.
Drain abscesses, iv ceftazidime, meropenem or imipenem followed by eradication treatment using cotrimoxazole, with or without doxycycline. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an alternative for those with resistant strains or where co-trimoxazole is contraindicated. Also usually sensitive to piperacillin or ticarcillin with clavulanic acid. There is an up to 10% relapse rate.
Rats and other rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the most important zoonotic reservoirs of human infection.
WEEV was first isolated during an equine epizootic in California in 1930. Eight years later WEEV was isolated from a fatal humanWEE case in California. TheWEEV distribution is limited to the Americas with human epidemics occurring in North America west of the Mississippi river and Brazil. WEEV does not occur at higher altitudes in the Rocky Mountains. In the USA it overlaps with eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) in Texas, Indiana, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and Michigan. It is absent from Central America (except Veracruz, Mexico). In South America, WEEV epizootics occur periodically in northern Argentina. The WEEV vector, Culex tarsalis, is associated with irrigated agriculture and stream drainages. The WEEV cycle in warmer regions is maintained and in colder areas it can be reintroduced by migratory birds or remain in an unknown reservoir host species. Between 1964 and 2005, there were 639 confirmed human WEE cases in the USA. In temperate regions the disease is seasonal with cases appearing during the warmer summer months. The incidence declined to less than 10 cases per year since 1988.
The 17D live, attenuated vaccine is protective after 10 days; revaccination is recommended every 10 years. Anti-mosquito precautions. Prevent infected individuals from mosquito exposure to break the transmission cycle.
Echinococcus multilocularis, a small (3–6 mm long) cyclophyllid cestode (tapeworm).
Microscopy of fresh skin snips to detect microfilariae. Nodule palpation. Rapid card tests based on antibody detection have been produced with promising results (but not yet available commercially). Luciferase immunoprecipitation system with a mixture of four O. volvulus antigens. Less-invasive techniques for disease surveillance are diethylcarbamazine patch tests (may become commercially available in near future), which provoke a local Mazzotti skin reaction.
None.
Rodent-to-rodent though saliva, excreta and bite, with humans as an accidental, dead-end host.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus of the Lentivirus genus and Retroviridae family, is divided into two main species HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more infectious and more virulent than HIV-2 and predominates globally, with HIV-2 transmission restricted to parts of Western and Central Africa.
Bilharziasis, Katayama fever or syndrome, urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis.
Polyarthritis and rash, epidemic polyarthritis, Barmah Forest virus disease, and Ross River virus disease, Murweh virus disease.
The mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic vertebrate host. The virus crosses the mosquito gut wall and replicates in the organs of the mosquito. After several days, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding.
Humans and possibly other primates (chimpanzees). Evidence of naturally occurring P. ovale in chimpanzees has been reported.
Hookworm eggs hatch in the soil and develop to infective larvae (L3) that can penetrate the skin. After entering the host, the larvae migrate to the lungs, move up the trachea and swallowed. In the gastrointestinal tract the larvae mature to adult worms (both sexes). After mating, the female hookworms produce up to 30,000 eggs per day that are shedded with the stools into the environment.
Humans.
Undulant fever, malta fever, Mediterranean fever.
Consumption, white plague, TB.
Serology or RT-PCR on blood or CSF; virus isolation.
Penicillin and metronidazole; rehydration; nutritional rehabilitation; treatment of predisposing diseases (e.g. malaria, measles, tuberculosis); wound disinfection; reconstructive surgery.
Supportive care; ribavirin iv is effective if given within the first 6 days after infection. There is no vaccine.
Together with tuberculosis and cryptococcosis, penicilliosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients in Southeast Asia. Though we could not find a report from Myanmar, it is expected to be present there. In northern Thailand it causes 15% of the HIV-related diseases. Before the HIV epidemic it was a rare disease in immunocompromised patients residing in endemic areas in Asia. Cases of penicilliosis have been described world wide, mainly in HIV patients with a travel history to endemic regions. A single case has been described from Ghana where there was no clear travel history to Southeast Asia. The association between bamboo rats and human infection is unclear. There is an association between infection risk and doing agricultural work, suggesting that soil exposure is a risk factor. The disease has a seasonal pattern with more cases during the rainy season.
It is an occupational risk for those working in the environment in endemic regions (e.g. farmers, soldiers). Dust control where feasible (e.g. paving roads). Arthroconidia are resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can survive for many years in dust. Screening of organ donors for coccidioidomycosis in endemic areas. As the fungus is easily aerosolized it is a laboratory hazard.
Kala-azar (Hindi for black sickness), black disease, dum-dum fever.
Rabies occurs in more than 150 countries and territories; world wide, more than 55,000 people die of rabies every year; 40% of people who are bitten by suspect rabid animals are children under 15 years of age. Dogs are the source of 99% of human rabies deaths, which is largely due to low rabies vaccination coverage of dogs in developing countries. Most cases of rabies in North America and Australia have been acquired from bats, often with no documented record of a bite. The USA was declared free of canine rabies transmission in 2007. In the Americas, dog rabies control reduced human cases to 16 by 2009. Every year, more than 15 million people world wide receive a preventive PEP regimen to avert the disease – this is estimated to prevent more than 327,000 rabies deaths annually.
Vaccination of children with three doses of Hib conjugate vaccine from the age of 2 months, with a booster dose aged 12–15 months. Since household contacts of confirmed cases of invasive Hib disease are at increased risk of disease, rifampicin prophylaxis is recommended for all household members if the household contains an infant or inadequately immunized children under the age of 3 years.
Deworming with mebendazole or albendazole; repeat treatment in case eggs are still detected in feces. Iron supplementation to correct anemia.
Bartonella bacilliformis, a fastidious intracellular Gramnegative bacterium.
In the absence of vaccination, Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5. In developed countries (prior to immunization), Hib was the commonest cause of bacterial meningitis in young children, but in countries with high vaccination coverage Hib is now almost eliminated as a public health problem. In developing countries Hib meningitis is common but Hib pneumonia appears to be even more common, with pneumonia morbidity and mortality exceeding that of meningitis. In 2000 Hib is estimated to have caused around 8 million cases of severe invasive disease and 360,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age. Ten countries, all in Africa and Asia, accounted for an estimated 61% of all these Hib deaths. Hib pneumonia is estimated to be responsible for around 16% of pneumonia deaths in HIV-negative children, therefore Hib makes an important contribution to the high childhood mortality rates and low life expectancy of Sub-Saharan Africa. Global coverage with three doses of Hib vaccine was estimated at 28% in 2008, with overall coverage of around 90% in the Americas, 65% in Europe, 40% in Africa, and less than 5% in Asia and the Pacific. The introduction of Hib vaccination has however been accelerating and by the end of 2009, in 83% of WHO Member States (160/193), Hib is included in the national immunization schedule.
Serology (acute and convalescent sera) using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Isolation of leptospira from blood or CSF during first 10 days of illness and urine during the 2nd and 3rd weeks; PCR may provide early diagnosis. Dark-field microscopy is not recommended.
Filarial nematode (roundworm), Loa loa. Adult worms are nematodes that live freely in subcutaneous tissue. Adult females are 40–70 mm long and males are 30–34mm long.
Virus isolation in cell culture; RT-PCR; antigen detection; serology by IgM ELISA. The virus is a BSL-4 agent.
Common unspecific symptoms are acute febrile illness with chills, sweats, nausea, headache, and vomiting; high fever with chills is more common in P. vivax than in P. falciparum malaria. Recent reports provide evidence that vivax malaria is not as benign as previously thought. P. vivax can lead to severe anemia, acute respiratory distress, liver failure, renal failure, and even cerebral malaria.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Aquatic insects; in southern Australia mosquitoes; not yet fully understood.
Protection from vector bites by wearing permethrin-treated light-colored clothes and fly repellent on exposed skin. DEC can be used as prophylaxis, but should not be used routinely.
Only ardeid birds and pigs have a sufficient viremia to infect mosquitoes. The mosquito picks up the virus from the blood of a viremic host. After a few days, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host when bitten. Humans are incidental and dead-end hosts as viremia does not reach sufficient levels to infect mosquitoes.
Fever, cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. Flukes may invade the brain and rarely the spinal cord, causing meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, and paralysis. They may also cause acute and chronic inflammation of the pleura, pericardium, and mediastinum. Chest Xray findings are similar to tuberculosis. Complications include pleural effusion, pneumothorax, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary fibrosis.
Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive rod-shaped intracellular bacterium. There are at least 13 serotypes, with serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b causing most disease. L. ivanovii is a very rare enteric opportunistic human pathogen.
Polioviral fever, infantile paralysis, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), bulbar polio.
California encephalitis, Jamestown Canyon encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis.
Female phlebotomine sandflies (Lutzomyia spp.).
Avoid tick bites, use repellent on skin and repellent or acaricide on clothing, check body daily for ticks after exposure, boil or pasteurize milk from cows, sheep, and goats in endemic areas. An inactivated vaccine is available. Specific hyperimmune globulin used in the past as prophylaxis after tick-bite may worsen the disease.
Serology (IFA,ELISA)or RT-PCR on bloodor CSF. Serology may cross-react with otherflaviviruses andlead to false-positives. Plaque Reduction Neutralization Tests (PRNT) and virus isolation are only done in specialized laboratories.
Tetanus is globally distributed but is more common in highly populated agricultural areas, and in warm and wet regions. In the late 1980s tetanus was estimated to cause around 1 million deaths per year, mostly in newborn infants. The current distribution of cases represents the coverage of tetanus immunization in children and adults. In countries with good vaccine coverage in children, adult cases may still be common, as natural immunity plays no role in the epidemiology of tetanus. The DTP3 Vaccination Coverage map shows coverage with the third dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine in childhood. The elimination of neonatal tetanus was set as a goal in 1989 and by mid2010 neonatal tetanus had been eliminated in 79% (153/193) of WHO Member States. However, since C. tetani will always remain present in nature, tetanus will always remain a threat, and high levels of immunization must be maintained indefinitely.
Ingestion of tapeworm eggs from feces of foxes, dogs, and cats or contaminated fomites. There is no person-to-person transmission.
Diphyllobothriosis, Dibothriocephaliasis, broad or fish tapeworm infection
Blister,usually on the leg or foot,which burns or itches, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, dizziness and generalized urticaria. Multiple and repeat infections occur, there is no protective immunity. Painful and infected ulcers can incapacitate patients for months. Secondary bacterial infection can lead to abscesses, synovitis, ankylosis andlimbcontractures, septic arthritis, and life-threatening sepsis.
Hendra virus: through contact with infectious body fluids, including urine, saliva, and nasal discharge, or during autopsy of infected horses. Nipah virus: through contact with infectious body fluids, including bat saliva (on fallen fruit and in date palm sap), or droplets from coughing infected pigs. In Bangladesh, half of reported cases between 2001 and 2008 were due to human-to-human transmission.
Small wild mammals such as rodents, snowshoe hares, deer and vector mosquitoes (venereal and transovarian transmission occur). Dayfeeding chipmunks and squirrels are the principal amplifying hosts of LACV, as the main vector (Aedes triseriatus) only bites in daytime. For this reason, nightfeeding small mammals are rarely infected with LACV. The white-tailed deer is the main amplifying host for JCV (horses can also be an amplifying host). Snowshoe hares and the arctic ground squirrel are the amplifying hosts of SSHV.
Principally wild birds in North America. Wild rodents, bats, reptiles, or amphibians may also be involved. Pheasants may serve as sentinels as they develop fatal disease. Chickens are more typically used as sentinels by detection of seroconversion.
Depends on portal of entry. The skin lesion is a characteristic black eschar surrounded by edema, usually on the head, forearms or hands, accompanied by malaise and fever, in 80% of cases resolving spontaneously after 7–10 days, but if left untreated it may evolve into fatal septicemia. GI anthrax produces nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, hematemesis, occasionally bloody diarrhea and often fatal septicemia and shock. Inhalation anthrax is rapidly progressive and starts with fever, malaise and mild cough and chest pain, evolving to acute respiratory distress, diagnostic mediastinal widening, cyanosis and shock. Untreated cutaneous anthrax has a CFR of 5–20% (<1% with treatment), GI anthrax 25–60%, and inhalation anthrax 100% (75% with treatment).
Maduromycosis, Madura foot
Epidemic hepatitis, infectious hepatitis, infectious jaundice, catarrhal jaundice.
Historically, dracunculiasis was endemic in 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, with an incidence of 3.5 million cases per year (1986). An international control effort reduced that to just over 1,785 cases detected in five African countries by 2010: Mali, Ghana, South Sudan, Chad, and Ethiopia. Nearly 95% of the cases are reported from South Sudan. Additionally, Niger reported 3 imported cases from Mali. Chad did not report cases for more than 10 years when an outbreak occurred with 10 cases in 2010. In Mali and Southern Sudan, violence has interfered with the eradication campaign, but Ghana and Ethiopia are close to eradication. Ghana diagnosed their last indigenous case in May 2010. Dracunculiasis mainly affects poor communities without a safe portable water supply and is mainly limited to remote nomadic communities. There is a marked increase in infection in the dry season when stagnant pools are the only source of water. Most cases are young (working) adults who may be exposed to contaminated water sources more frequently. There is no particular age or sex predilection. Countries free of transmission neighboring endemic countries should remain alert for imported cases and take adequate preventive measures.
Chinese liver fluke, Oriental liver fluke.
Serology (IF, EIA); PCR; culture in mice or cell lines.
Self-limiting disease. Sudden onset of joint pain; fatigue, marked arthralgia and myalgia in more than 40%, stiff and swollen joints in 60–85% of cases; anorexia, headache, back pain, photophobia, sore throat, lethargy, and lymphadenopathy also occur, with fever and a maculopapular rash, usually on the trunk and limbs but also on palms and soles, in 50% of cases. Relapses occur; joint pains and swelling may relapse for as long as 6 years. Patients eventually recover completely.
Environment (soil) to human. Fungal spores are inhaled and convert to the pathogenic yeast form in the lung from where they can disseminate to other organs.
Microscopy of Giemsa-stained blood film; differentiation from P. vivax can be difficult and result in misidentification; parasite load is generally low and may be undetectable by light microscopy; in regions where P. falciparum/P. vivax predominate, P. ovale is frequently overlooked; parasitemia is present for about 2 weeks; PCR.
Argentinian (Junin virus), Bolivian (Machupo virus), Brazilian (Sabia virus), and Venezuelan (Guanarito virus) hemorrhagic fevers.
Intestinal capillariasis starts with mild abdominal pain, borborygmus, and diarrhea, that develops to profuse watery diarrhea. If untreated: chronic diarrhea, vomiting, malabsorption, leading to weight loss, muscle wasting, cachexia, and eventually death. Hepatic capillariasis (C. hepatica) is a (sub)acute hepatitis with eosinophilia, that may disseminate to other organs and can be fatal. Pulmonary capillariasis (C. aerophila) may present with fever, cough, asthma, and pneumonia and may also be fatal.
Rodent control; those with occupational exposure to rodents (e.g. sewage workers) should wear personal protective clothing; avoid close contact with reservoir animals, including pets; prophylaxis with penicillin or doxycycline following rat bite.
Humans. Asymptomatic carriage of N.meningitidis in the oropharynx is common, although carriage rates vary widely by geographic and epidemiological setting. The carrier state is immunizing and development of meningococcal disease is associated with recent acquisition.
There are two different groups of etiologic agents: fungi and bacteria. Fungal mycetoma is called eumycetoma, and at least 34 fungal species have been implicated. The fungi Madurella mycetomatis and Pseudallescheria boydii are the most common fungal causative agents of eumycetoma. Bacterial mycetoma is called actinomycetoma and at least 14 actinomycetes have been implicated, of which the bacterial species of Nocardia, Streptomyces and Actinomadura are the most common causative agents of actinomycetoma.
Rodents, principally rats and sylvatic ground squirrels: marmots, susliks, and prairie dogs. Rabbits, camels, carnivores, and domestic cats may also be infected. Cats can also develop pneumonic plague. The desert regions of Central Asia contain endemic plague foci where the great gerbil is the main host.
Dipstick test, dark-field or phase microscopy on fecal or rectal swab smear; bacterial culture.
Enteric by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products (soft cheese, yoghurt) from infected animals; direct inoculation of mucosa or skin with infected animal tissue (usually occupational in farmers or butchers); inhalation in housing of infected animals. Brucellosis is an occupational disease in shepherds, abattoir workers, veterinarians, dairy industry workers, and microbiology laboratory staff. No person-to-person transmission apart from isolated case reports of sexual transmission.
Fasciolopsis buski, a large trematode worm that can be up to 75 mm long.
The multi-mammate rat (Mastomys natalensis), which lives in houses and surrounding fields. Previous studies that identified M. erythroleucus and M. huberti as reservoirs may have confused the species. M. natalensis is generally absent in coastal West Africa.
Mayaro virus (MAYV), an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, belonging to the Semliki Forest virus complex.
Streptobacillosis: Streptobacillus moniliformis (formerly Actinobacillus muris, Haverhillia multiformis), a Gramnegative, non-motile pleiomorphic rod-like bacterium. Spirillosis: Streptobacillosis: Streptobacillus moniliformis (formerly Actinobacillus muris, Haverhillia multiformis), a Gramnegative, non-motile pleiomorphic rod-like bacterium.
Virus detection by RT-PCR of respiratory specimens is recommended; virus culture requires a BSL-3 facility. Microneutralization assay is recommended to detect antibodies to A/H5N1. Rapid antigen tests are not recommended due to lack of sensitivity.
Contamination of a break in the skin by bacilli in the environment, or by the bite of an infected aquatic insect or mosquito. Person-to-person transmission is rare.
A progressive chronic illness of the skin and mucous membranes in the genital and perigenital regions with painless granulomatous ulcers and regional lymphadenopathy. Nodular skin lesions can appear as lymphadenopathy, known as ‘pseudobulbar.’ The painless lesions are often found in warm moist body regions and bleed easily. Lesions can be progressive and cause local tissue destruction. Systemic spread is rare but bones and internal organs may eventually be infected.
Personal protection from sandfly bites (e.g. protective clothing, insecticide-treated bednets, residual insecticiding of breeding places).
Tetracycline, doxyxyline. Alternative: chloramphenicol.
Rodent to rodent with spill over to humans in case of adequate exposure.
None
In 1988, the WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). The Americas were certified polio-free in 1994, the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and Europe in 2002 (in 2010, there was importation of polio into Europe). The GPEI has four main strategies to stop transmission of the wild poliovirus: (1) high infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the first year of life; (2) supplementary doses of OPV to all children under 5 years of age during SIAs; (3) surveillance for wild poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases among children under 15 years of age; (4) targeted campaigns once wild poliovirus transmission is limited to a specific focal area. To be certified polio-free, three conditions must be met: (1) there are at least 3 years of zero polio cases due to wild poliovirus; (2) disease surveillance efforts in countries meet international standards; and (3) each country must illustrate the capacity to detect, report, and respond to ‘imported’ polio cases. Oral live attenuated polio vaccines can give rise to circulation of vaccinederived polioviruses and rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. For this reason, efforts are underway to develop affordable options for inactivated polio vaccination.
Tick to mammalian host to tick for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma; trematode to aquatic host to trematode for Neorickettsia. Human is a dead-end host for all. During the eclipse phase of both HME and HGA infection, the blood remains potentially infectious by blood transfusion.
Supportive with pain management.
The precise mechanism is unclear: probably by aerosol spread of nasal secretions from a case to respiratory mucosa of close contacts. M. leprae cannot cross intact skin. The relative risk for leprosy disease in household contacts is 8 to 10 for multibacillary (lepromatous) leprosy and 2 to 4 for paucibacillary (tuberculoid) leprosy.
Gradual onset of malaise, headache, and retro-orbital pain, conjunctivitis, fever, and sweats, followed by prostration. Petechiae on the soft palate are frequent, on the body with ecchymoses less frequent. In severe cases: epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, hematuria, and gingival hemorrhage. Enceplalopathy, intention tremors, depressed deep tendon reflexes, bradycardia, and hypotension with shock are common. Infection during pregnancy can result in abortion. Convalescence may be prolonged. CFR due to these viruses, even after intensive hospital treatment, can be as high as 33%.
Brucellosis is a common zoonosis with approximately 500,000 new cases per year world wide. The disease occurs mostly in areas where it is common to consume unpasteurized dairy products (soft cheese) and where poor veterinary health systems exist. The main Brucella infecting species vary by region. Incidence is highest in males with occupational exposure. The highest incidences are recorded in Mediterranean countries, Middle East, Central America, and Central Asia. Five of 10 countries with highest incidences are in the Middle East, with Syria leading. Many of the high-incidence countries were formerly part of the Soviet Union. Since their independence the veterinary health system has deteriorated, leading to an increase in brucellosis cases. In the USA it is mainly reported in Hispanics eating imported infected food. The disease is not considered highly endemic in South America. Data from Brazil is lacking, despite high cattle densities in this country (see Livestock map). Many western European countries have brucellosis-free status. Mediterannean European countries implemented eradication campaigns, but still a high prevalence exists, especially in the Balkan peninsula. In eastern Europe the disease is limited to veterinarians.
Vivax malaria; recurring malaria; tertian malaria; paludism; marsh fever; ague.
Coxiellosis, Query fever.
Isolation of agent from blood, urine, sputum, pus or skin lesions; direct immunofluorescence; serology. PCR may be of value on samples other than blood.
Pig-to-pig, with occasional spill-over to humans.
Humans.
Virus detection in the blood by RT-PCR or virus isolation; IgM ELISA is available, cross-reactivity may occur with other flaviviruses.
A granulomatous fungal infection of the lung, skin, bone or genitourinary tract. Pulmonary infection may be acute or chronic. Acute: fever, cough and pulmonary infiltrate, resolving in 1–3 weeks. Chronic infection is more common and characterized by erythematous papules on the face and extremities, low-grade fever, and weight loss; pulmonary infection may cavitate. Occasionally bone, prostate, epididymis and central nervous system may be affected. Untreated disseminated or chronic pulmonary disease is generally fatal. The main differential diagnosis is tuberculosis.
Detection of toxin in serum, stool or wound by mouse inoculation or ELISA; culture of the bacterium from stool or wound; electromyography.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an enveloped RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. CHIKV belongs to the same antigenic complex as Mayaro, Ross River, and o’nyong-nyong viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests an African origin about 500 years ago, with spread to Asia within the last century.
By tick bites, except for N. sennetsu, which is probably transmitted through ingestion of uncooked, parasitized aquatic hosts. No person-to-person spread except by blood transfusion.
Measles has a worldwide distribution, but is eliminated from the western hemisphere through vaccination. Measles deaths world wide fell by 78% from an estimated 733,000 in 2000 to 164,000 in 2008; all regions but one have achieved the United Nations goal of reducing measles mortality by 90%, however, it remains the leading cause of vaccinepreventable deaths in children and there are fears of a resurgence if vaccination falters for lack of resources. WHO figures for 2008 were 282,000 reported cases, with many thousands more unreported. Some 58% of countries have 90% or more vaccine coverage, adequate to stop transmission, but endemic countries have case fatality rates of up to 30% in places. Most measles deaths ( > 95%) occur in countries with a per capita income of <US$ 1,000. Measles-free countries still have imported cases and limited outbreaks in subpopulations with low or no vaccination coverage (e.g. religious communities). Measles is being considered for global elimination or even eradication.
Reservoir host to mosquito to reservoir host; 2–5 days viremia in host, 5–7 days in mosquito, then back into host.
A killed vaccine is available for laboratory workers, but is not recommended for use in epidemics. In buildings or rodent burrows, flea control with insecticide should be followed by rat destruction (killing rats liberates fleas); rat control in ports and ships. Chemoprophylaxis of pneumonic plague contacts. Pneumonic cases should be isolated.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Animal–mosquito–animal with spillover to humans in epidemics via direct/indirect contact to infected animal tissue or mosquito bite.
Most commonly, the urban container-breeding, daybitingmosquitoesAedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus; in Polynesia, Ae. scutellaris complex spp.; in Malaysia, Ae. nivaeus complex spp., in West Africa, Ae. furcifer-taylori complex spp., and recently in Europe by Ae. albopictus (see Aedes map).
Rodent–rodent, with humans as accidental dead-end hosts. Infected reservoir hosts are asymptomatic and excrete infectious virus in the urine.
For LBRF, humans; for TBRF, wild rodents, bats and ticks (by trans-stadial and transovarian transmission). B. duttonii has thus far not been detected in wild animals, only in humans and tick vector O. moubata. Livestock may also become infected.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Unclear, but likely through inhalation of P. marneffei conidia from the environment; cutaneous inoculation may also occur. There is no human-to-human transmission.
Enteric fever, typhus abdominalis.
By animal bite through saliva commonly or scratch (rarely). Infected livestock do not bite typically, but may infect a person through their saliva. Very rare: licks upon mucosal surfaces; aerosols in bat-infested caves; person-toperson transmission via organ/tissue transplantation. Rabies can be transmitted via slaughtering of infected reservoir species, for instance dogs in countries where dogs are consumed.
Through contamination of penetrating wounds (e.g. by thorns, splinters). There is no person-to-person transmission.
Barmah Forest virus (BFV) and Ross River virus (RRV), enveloped RNA viruses, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. An early isolate of BF from Queensland was initially named Murweh virus. There are two topotypes of Ross River virus, from eastern and western Australia; a third, in northeastern Australia, has not been found since the mid-1970s.
Tularemia has six characteristic clinical syndromes, depending on the site of infection: ulceroglandular (commonest), glandular, oropharyngeal, pneumonic, oculoglandular, and typhoidal. Clinical signs include sudden onset of high fever, chills, generalized aches, and chronic ulcer at the bite site (ulceroglandular). From the primary site, lymphatic spread to regional lymphnodes. Further hematogeneous dissemination to other organs. CFR for Type A (ulcero) glandular disease is < 2% if treated promptly (5 to 30% if not treated). In the acute septic form (typhoidal) of the disease, lymphadenopathy and ulcer are absent, and the CFR is high (30–60%). Oculoglandular disease is rare. Ingestion of infected material may result in oropharyngeal or GI tularemia. In the oropharyngeal form signs are: throat pain, large tonsils, pseudomembrane, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Symptoms in GI tularemia range from mild persistent diarrhea to extensive intestinal ulcers and death. Pneumonic tularemia occurs after inhalation of bacteria, or secondary from other entry sites and may progress to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death.
Lagomorphs and rodents (ground squirrels) for F. tularensis (Types A and B) in North America. Aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in North America, hares and small rodents in northern Eurasia, for F. holarctica (Type B). The bacterium can persist in water.
Humans.
Direct transmission via skin to skin or oral contact (also via sharing drinking and eating utensils). Sharing of drinking vessels plays an important role in transmission of endemic syphilis in arid regions. There is little or no mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy.
Rarely by tick bite.
Small (6–18 mm long) trematode liver fluke of dogs, cats, and some other fish-eating mammals:Opisthorchis felineus in Europe and northern Asia, O. viverrini in Southeast Asia. Both species live in bile ducts.
The vector becomes infected with OROV by feeding on a viremic host. The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the insect. After a few days, depending on the ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding. Jungle cycle: OROV is transmitted among sloths, marsupials, primates, and birds by the mosquitoes Aedes serratus and Culex quinquefasciatus. Urban cycle: OROV is transmitted to humans by midges (Culicoides paraensis).
Leprosy control is achieved by timely detection and treatment of new cases. BCG vaccination provides variable protection: from 34% to 80%. Chemoprophylaxis and quarantine are not recommended. M. leprae bacilli remain viable for 9 days in dried nasal secretions and about 6 weeks in moist soil.
Soil, decaying vegetation.
Gastric anisakidosis: findings depend on where in the gastrointestinal tract the ingested larvae embed. Gastric anisakidosis is the predominant form with acute severe gastric pain, nausea, and vomiting and sometimes hematemesis. Intestinal anisakiasis can cause abdominal pain, obstruction, peritonitis, ulceration, and bleeding. Anisakis-associated hypersensitivity is increasingly being reported and varies from acute urticaria to anaphylaxis. Pharyngeal anisakiasis is rare with pharyngeal irritation as the main symptom.
Food-borne and transplacental (mother to child). Ingestion of L. monocytogenes occurs commonly world wide. Development of the disease depends on the host immunity.
None.
Invasive disease: tinidazole or metronidazole. For severe amebic colitis antibiotics are added to prevent and treat bacterial peritonitis. Surgery for intra-abdominal complications (e.g. bleeding, perforation). Aspiration for liver abscesses. Intraluminal parasites and asymptomatic infection are treated with paromomycin.
Pulmonary distomiasis, lung fluke disease
Eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, angiostrongyliasis
Common presenting symptoms are: influenza-like symptoms (fever, dry cough, chills, myalgia), headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort with abdominal tenderness, coated tongue, and hepatosplenomegaly. Adults may have constipation, while young children and HIV patients more often have diarrhea. In 5–30% a rash is present on the abdomen and chest. Children <5 years regularly have unspecific symptoms and remain undiagnosed. Complications occur in 10–15%, including GI bleeding (most common), intestinal perforation, and typhoid encephalopathy. CFR is approximately 2% (range: Common presenting symptoms are: influenza-like symptoms (fever, dry cough, chills, myalgia), headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort with abdominal tenderness, coated tongue, and hepatosplenomegaly. Adults may have constipation, while young children and HIV patients more often have diarrhea. In 5–30% a rash is present on the abdomen and chest. Children <5 years regularly have unspecific symptoms and remain undiagnosed. Complications occur in 10–15%, including GI bleeding (most common), intestinal perforation, and typhoid encephalopathy.
The disease is thought to have originated in the tropics and subtropics of Africa and Asia. WHO reported 213,036 leprosy cases at the beginning of 2009. Although the worldwide prevalence has declined in the last two decades, the incidence has remained the same. India had the most new cases in 2008 (134,000), followed by Brazil (39,000), and Indonesia (17,000). Males are affected more than females (2:1); young children are rarely infected. Epicurves for PL show a peak at age 15 followed by a trough at age 20. WHO considers that leprosy has been eliminated as a public health problem in any country when the prevalence is less than 1 case per 10,000 population. In 2007, the DRC and Mozambique achieved that status. Also India reported that their national prevalence is below 1/10,000. However, pockets of high endemicity still remain in some areas within those countries. Decreased prevalence without a reduction in incidence maylead to an increase of cases as countries may be less committed to control them once they meet elimination status. Foci in Brazil are found in the Amazonian jungle, but also in arid areas. Poverty and crowded dwellings are important risk factors. Leprosy in North America and Europe has declined to zero cases in line with improvement in living conditions.
South American blastomycosis, Brazilian blastomycosis, Lutz–Splendore–Almeida disease.
Monkeypox virus (MPV), a double-stranded DNA virus of the genus Orthopoxvirus, family Poxviridae. Two clades of monkeypox viruses are known: the West African virus and the Congo Basin virus. The Congo Basin strain is more virulent than the West African strain. The MPV genome is > 96% identical to the variola virus genome. However, MPV is not a direct ancestor or descendent of variola virus.
P. knowlesi transmission is restricted to the Leucosphyrus group of anophelines, consisting of 20 species.
Detection of trypanosomes in blood, lymph, or CSF after concentration; IgM ELISA, IFA, PCR. A card agglutination trypanosomiasis test (CATT) is available for T. b. gambiense but not T. b. rhodesiense.
Screening blood and blood products before use, bottle-feeding (20% of breast-fed infants of infected mothers become infected), using condoms. Counseling and education of IVDUs to implement harm reduction practices.
By bite of the female sandfly (usually at dusk and at sundown, often indoors); rarely by blood transfusion or transplacental. There is no direct person-to-person transmission.
Wild rodents (gerbils) that live in burrows together with sandfly vector. Hyraxes for L. aethiopica.
Buruli ulcer is named after Buruli county in Uganda, where the disease was common in the 1960s. The disease is reported in 30 countries with tropical climates, but it may occur in some temperate regions. West Africa is the most affected region. Typical Buruli endemic regions are areas with slow-flowing or stagnant water. Flooding due to deforestation or the construction of dams, and irrigation systems such as rice fields, can lead to outbreaks. Outbreaks have also been associated with mining activities in Africa, due to creation of pits with stagnant water. In southern Australia several coastal towns have reported local outbreaks. It is unclear what triggered these outbreaks. World wide, mainly children are susceptible to Buruli ulcer disease.
Standard anti-mosquito precautions. There is no vaccine available.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
By mosquito bite. Experiments demonstrated human to human transmission with the mosquito as vector, but there is no direct human-to-human transmission.
Yersinia pestis, a Gram-negative bacillus. Y. pestis is considered a potential biological warfare agent.
The sandfly Lutzomyia verrucarum. Preferred habitat: narrow river gorges at elevations between 500 and 3,200 meters.
FA staining of frozen skin sections taken from the nape of the neck, or postmortem brain tissue; RT-PCR on saliva, skin or brain biopsy or buccal swab; serology; cell culture or mouse inoculation from saliva, skin, or brain.
Sudden onset of fever (which may be biphasic), malaise, weakness, irritability, headache, severe pain in limbs and loins and marked anorexia; occasionally vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hemorrhage in oropharynx, nose, lungs, uterus, intestines; hematomas, echymosis, and petechiae; hematuria and albuminuria. In Russia, estimates are that only 1 in 6 cases is hemorrhagic. The CFR ranges from 2 to 80% in different countries.
Humans. Loa loa also infects some monkeys but the human and simian cycles seem to be independent.
A generally mild and short-lived illness with fever, coryza, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and a fine maculopapular rash beginning on the face later spreading to the trunks and limbs. Postauricular, occipital or posterior cervical lymphadenopathy may precede the rash by 5–10 days. Around half of rubella infections are subclinical and constitutional symptoms may be minimal in children. Arthropathy may occur, especially in young women. The most important clinical consequence of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which may result from intra-uterine infection in thefirst 16 weeks of pregnancy. CRS is a severe disease characterized by deafness, cataract, cardiac abnormalities, and a range of neurological impairments.
Anthrax has a worldwide distribution. Livestock vaccination, antibiotic treatment, and quarantaine regulations lead to a strong decline in anthraxinfections in domestic lifestock. Anthrax occurs mainly in rural areas in countries where there is no livestock vaccination and no veterinary control of slaughtered animals.There is a seasonal variation in animal disease with an increase in cases during hot dry weather. Anthrax is an occupational hazard for people who process contaminated animal tissues. GI anthrax occurs when infected tissue is ingested. Of note is the terrorist distribution of anthrax powder by mail in the USA in 2001, which killed 5 people and produced sickness in 17.
Sheep liver fluke disease, pharyngeal fascioliasis.
In addition to humans, dogs and fish-eating terrestrial and marine mammals can also serve as definitive hosts for D. latum.
Through breaks in skin, ingestion or aspiration of contaminated water, inhalation of contaminated dust. There are rare reports of transmission from human or animal cases to humans. Laboratory workers have been infected by aerosols.
Sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and can progress with signs of myalgia, photophobia, arthralgia, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and congestion of conjunctivae. After 3–4 days there can be a remission phase leading to either recovery or more severe disease with hemorrhagic signs (epistaxis, gingival bleeding, hematemesis, melena) and hepatorenal syndrome, multi-organ failure and death. CFR in severe cases is 15 to 50%.
The disease is self-limiting and acute symptoms are similar to acute hepatitis A disease. Children are generally asymptomatic or have mild disease. Clinical evident disease is more common in age group 15–44 years, with following symptoms: fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, and light stool. Pregnant women are at risk for severe disease, including fulminant hepatitis and death. In immunocompromised persons (e.g. transplant recipients or users of immune-modulating therapy) chronic infection has been reported.
The diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical features. The bacterium is usually not cultured from wounds and a positive culture does not confirm the diagnosis.
Compatible clinical features, a characteristic MRI (pulvinar sign) and the exclusion of other neurological diseases, are usually sufficient to diagnose ‘probable vCJD.’ Definitive diagnosis of vCJD is by neuropathological examination of the brain, usually at postmortem.
None. Diagnosis is made by clinical examination.
Clostridium tetani, a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium. The spores can remain viable in the environment for years. C. tetani produces a highly potent exotoxin, tetanospasmin, which is responsible for the clinical features of tetanus.
Praziquantel is recommended; alternative: oxamniquine for S. mansoni, metrifonate for S. haematobium.
None.
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control, disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas.
Inhalation of contaminated aerosols generated from infected animal body fluids (placenta, urine, milk, feces) or dust contaminated with dried animal excretions. Less common routes are enterally when consuming contaminated food products and possibly through skin inoculation. Personto-person transmission is rare.
Human buccal flora.
Microscopy of stained smear from a bubo, sputum or CSF shows characteristic ‘safety-pin’ shape; serology (IFA; ELISA); rapid dipstick test. Culture takes about 4 days.
None.
Vector control; mosquito repellent; insecticidetreated bed nets; treatment of infected humans.
Tacaribe complex viruses are spherical or pleomorphic, enveloped arenaviruses containing two single-stranded RNA molecules, with four distinct lineages (A, B, C, and a recombinant RecA). Out of more than 20 known arenaviruses, only the following have been associated with human disease: Chapare, Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, Sabia, and Whitewater Arroyo viruses. All South American hemorrhagic fever viruses, except Whitewater Arroyo virus, are classified as high-priority bioterrorism pathogens. Other Tacaribe complex arenaviruses are capable of infecting humans and possibly cause disease.
Culture is the gold standard but is insensitive. PCR is more sensitive than culture. Serology may be helpful in patients presenting 3 weeks or more after cough onset, when both culture and PCR are likely to be negative.
90% of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic; 10% develop invasive-intestinal disease (colitis), and <1% extra-intestinal disease (liver abscess). Amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps, weight loss, and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea; most patients are afebrile. Amebic colitis rarely progresses to necrotizing colitis, ameboma, and toxic megacolon. Amebic colitis affects children and adults equally, but mainly males. Amebic liver-abscess mainly occurs in men aged 18 to 50 years, for unknown reasons. E. moshkovskii can cause non-invasive diarrhea.
Transmission to humans occurs by rubbing infected louse feces into abraded skin or into the conjunctivae.
Plasmodium ovale, an intacellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa. Phylogenetically, P. ovale clusters with other Plasmodium species affecting simian primates.
By mosquito bite.
Inhalation of spores from disturbed soil. There is no person-to-person transmission.
Consumption of raw or undercooked uneviscerated fish that have ingested infected feces of humans or waterfowl. There is no person-to-person transmission.
Piscivorous (fish-eating) mammals, including: humans, dogs, cats, pigs, rats, and several species of wild animals. Humans can remain infected for several decades.
For C. philippinensis: fish-eating birds. Freshwater fish are intermediate hosts.
Via tick bite. Or consumption of raw milk or dairy products from infected animals. For EUR, rarely, by blood transfusion and breast milk.
Mebendazole or albendazole; radical surgical excision.
By sexual contact. In children with no history of abuse, the route of transmission is unclear. Several reported pediatric cases have been in contact with infected adults, but without evidence of sexual contact.
Rabies virus, a rhabdovirus of the genus Lyssavirus, with a nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA genome. At least 11 different genotypes exist, with genotype 1, rabies virus (RABV) causing classic rabies world wide. Genotypes 2–11 have a more limited host-range and geographic distribution: Lagos bat virus (LBV), Mokola virus (MOKV), Duvenhage virus (DUVV), European bat lyssa virus 1 and 2 (EBLV-1/2), Australian bat lyssa virus (ABLV), Aravan virus (ARAV), Irkut virus (IRKV), Khujand virus (KHUV), and West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV).
Fleas, especially the rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) and possibly human flea (Pulex irritans).
It is estimated that 37 million people are infected worldwide, 97% of them in Africa, and remaining in small foci in Central and South America and Yemen. Onchocerciasis was imported into Latin America by the slave trade. Onchocerciasis prevalence is related to the proximity to riverine breeding sites of black flies, with the highest disease burden in communities adjacent to rivers. Prevalence of infection rises with age until around 20 years, after which infection profiles vary between geographical region and sex. Higher rates of morbidity are reported in men. This variation canbe explainedby heterogeneity in age, gender, and occupational exposure to vectors.
Sudden onset of fever lasting 2–7 days, sometimes biphasic, severe headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and a maculopapular rash (not easily seen on dark skin). Most cases recover. Minor occurrence of petechiae, epistaxis, or gingival bleeding may be seen. Serious hemorrhagic manifestations, like a severe drop in blood platelets, indicate dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), that can progress to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death. Infection with any serotype results in lasting homologous immunity, but little cross-immunity to other serotypes. Cross-immunity may exacerbate, rather than diminish, disease severity when infected with a new serotype; DHF leading to DSS can occur as a secondary infection with a different serotype, but DHF/DSS has also been reported in primary infections. CFR for DHF is up to 20%, for untreated DSS up to 50%, and 1–2% if correctly treated.
The first human P. knowlesi case acquired in nature was detected in 1965 in Malaysia. P. knowlesi malaria is widely distributed across Sarawak and Sabah in Malaysian Borneo and extends to the state of Pahang in Peninsular Malaysia. P. knowlesi malaria cases have also been acquired in Thailand, Myanmar, Singapore, and the Philippines. The distribution and incidence of P. knowlesi malaria is yet unknown. Bases on current knowledge on the vector and reservoir, human knowlesi malaria is likely not rare in areas inhabited by the natural macaque hosts and the vectors. Humans working in the vicinity of forests are considered at risk. Deforestation now also brings humans in semi-urban areas into contact with reservoir hosts. Interestingly, P. knowlesi has been used in the past as a pyretic agent for the treatment of patients with neurosyphilis.
Half of the infected patients are asymptomatic and those with symptoms usually have mild disease. The most common presentations of acute Q fever are pneumonia, hepatitis, and isolated fever. Other symptoms are neurological (headache, confusion, peripheral neuropathy), sore throat, chills, sweats, rash, and non-productive cough. Proportion of people presenting with pneumonia or hepatitis varies by region and immune status. CFR: 1–2%. Chronic Q fever occurs 1 to 20 years after acute infection and most often presents as endocarditis in patients with pre-existing heart disease (valve abnormality).
The incidence of Noma and the prevalence of survivors of Noma are not well known. In 1998, WHO estimated that 770,000 people had been affected in the past and survived the affection, and that 140,000 new cases were reported each year, of which 100,000 were between 1 and 7 years old and living in Sub-Saharan Africa. An estimation of the global incidence based on epidemiological field work in north-west Nigeria indicates 30,000 to 40,000 new cases per year. It occurs predominantly in debilitated and malnourished children, especially in underdeveloped countries. Peak incidence is at age 1–4 years, the period of growth retardation in deprived children. The etiology is multifactorial: malnutrition, concurrent infections with malaria or measles, bad oral hygiene, severe diarrhea and severe necrotic ulcerative gingivitis are risk factors. In developed countries sporadic cases occur in immune-compromised patients, neonates, HIV-positive and diabetic patients.
Amphotericin B iv or itraconazole. Long-term azole maintenance treatment is required in HIV patients to prevent relapses.
Supportive.
There is strong epidemiological and laboratory evidence for a causal relation between vCJD and the BSE agent. In the UK, the primary epidemic has been associated with dietary exposure to BSE-infected bovine material during the BSE epidemic in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, before effective controls to prevent the BSE agent entering the human food supply were put into place. Most people who have developed vCJD have lived in or visited the UK during this time period. The behavior of the vCJD agent under laboratory conditions is also very like that of BSE. There is a strong host genetic component, with certain variants of the prion protein gene being much more susceptible to vCJD
Viremic reservoir host to mosquito during feeding, then after an extrinsic cycle of a few days, the virus is transmitted to a new reservoir host during feeding.
By mosquito bite (Anopheles spp.); transmission has been described in needle sharing IVDUs and blood transfusion.
Sudden onset fever, frontal headache, backache, diarrhea and a rash; usually resolves without sequelae; fatalities are rare and the result of hemorrhage or meningoencephalitis. ILEV and NRIV can cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. CVV rarely causes encephalitis, with only one fatal case reported in the USA in 1995.
Treatment of uncomplicated B. quintana bacteremia is with a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin) or doxycyclin. In case of endocarditis 4–6 months of therapy is recommended in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin or gentamicin for the first 2–3 weeks. Heart valve replacement may be needed.
Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne diseasein both North America and Europe, where its incidence is increasing. Incidence is seasonal, corresponding to increased vector activity during summer. The three Borrelia species differ in geographic location, vectors, and clinical manifestations: B. burgdorferi ss is present both in North America and Europe, but is absent from Asia; B. garinii andB. afzelii occur in Europe and Asia. A recent study showed that B. garinii is the main genotype in China. Data of B. burgdorferi presence are lacking for South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia. In the USA the disease is focal: most cases come from limited areas in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions. In the Baltic region, disease rates are several fold higher than in the USA. Incidences vary, ranging from 0.3/ 100,000 in the UK to 130/100,000 in Austria. Climate change, more housing in wooded areas, and expanding populations of deer, and small rodents may be responsible for the increase in Lyme disease cases. None of the mammal species identified as reservoir hosts and none of the transmitting ticks are present in Australia.
Cutaneous anthrax: penicillin, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline po; severe anthrax (GI or inhalation): ciprofloxacin iv preferred. Clindamycin can inhibit toxin production.
Dry, sandy alkaline soil in the semi-arid zones of the USA–Mexico border and parts of Central and South America. In North America, the fungus is mainly found in the Lower Sonoran Life Zone with low rainfall and high temperatures C. immitis is present in California, and probably northern Mexico and Arizona, and C. posadasii is present in the remaining areas.
Breakbone fever.
Demonstration of multiple-budding cells in body fluid aspirates or tissue biopsy specimens by microscopy. Isolation of the fungus. Serology and histopathology.
Surgical extraction of adult worms from the eye. Diethylcarbamazine (DEC) is filaricidal but can cause SAEs in patients with heavy infection. SAEs can be reduced by coadministering antihistamines or steroids. Alternative: albendazole with a lower risk of SAEs in case of heavy infection.
Hendra virus: pteropid bats are the primary reservoir of Hendra virus and are asymptomatic. The viruses can be isolated from their reproductive tracts and urine. The epidemiological reasons for the emergence of Hendra virus infection in horses are not clear. All human cases had close contact with infected horses. Nipah virus outbreaks have occurred only in South Asia and may be associated with the bat-breeding season. In Malaysia, it was hypothesized that the bats fed on fruit trees in pig farms, and that fallen fruit contaminated with bat saliva containing Nipah virus was eaten by pigs, who became infected. Nipah viruses have been isolated from bats in Cambodia and Thailand, and a high seroprevalence has been found in fruit bats in NW India, in the absence of reported pig or human disease. In Bangladesh, there is epidemiologic evidence of bat–human transmission without an intermediate livestock host, and of human–human transmission. Young boys who gather fruit from the trees are at higher risk of disease. Also drinking palm sap from trees is a potential risk factor. Antibodies to henipaviruses have been found in fruit bats in Madagascar (Pteropus and Eidolon sp.) and in Ghana (Eidolon sp.), but in the absence of virus isolation or RNA detection, it is not possible to know which virus is involved. No human or animal cases have been reported in Madagascar or in Africa.
Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and B. timori, threadlike nematode worms 80 to 100 mm long (W. bancrofti), or 43 to 55 mm long (B. malayi).
Mainly a clinical diagnosis: subacute eosinophilic meningitis in an endemic area. Most common test is serology, but there are often false-positives due to cross-reactivity with other parasites. Worms are rarely seen in CSF by microscopy. MRI or CT scan of the brain is not diagnostic.
Chemotherapy is ineffective for treating aggressive forms of ATL. There is no satisfactory treatment for HAM/ TSP. Access to adequate counseling and correct information about HTLV is of fundamental importance for HTLV-1 seropositive individuals.
A combination of several ARVs is recommended, known as Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). Additional strategies include prophylaxis and vaccination against opportunistic infections, general measures to maintain nutrition and health, and treatment of specific infections or HIV-associated disorders.
Need to treat both P. ovale blood and liver stage with chloroquine (blood stage) and primaquine (liver stage).
Francisella tularensis tularensis (Type A), F. tularensis holarctica (Type B), F. tularensis mediasiatica, Gram-negative non-motile intracellular coccobacilli that infect macrophages. Type A is highly virulent and divided into two clades: Francisella tularensis tularensis (Type A), F. tularensis holarctica (Type B), F. tularensis mediasiatica, Gram-negative non-motile intracellular coccobacilli that infect macrophages.
Ticks of the genera Amblyomma and Ixodes.
None.
WHO (2010) estimates that there are over 120 million infections world wide, with 40 million patients incapacitated or disfigured by the disease, principally in India and Sub Saharan Africa. 90% of the infections are due to W. bancrofti. Chronic manifestations mainly occur in the elderly. About 27 million have hydrocele (men) and 16 million have lymphedema or elephantiasis of theleg (mostly women). Asia and South America have lower Bancroftian filariasis prevalences (below 8%) than Sub Saharan Africa (up to 37%) and Pacific Island (up to 48%) regions. Within areas of low prevalence, pockets of high prevalence may exist (e.g. Reciffe, Brazil). In the Americas there is only active transmission in four countries and mainly affects the poor and slum inhabitants. China has been declared non-endemic for lymphatic filariasis since 2007 and Korea in 2008, achieved by extensive control efforts. The vectors are still present and therefore there remains a risk of re-emergence.
Ova are excreted with the feces of infected animals, and develop into larvae which are ingested by squid and other invertebrates – these in turn are ingested by fish which may be eaten raw by humans. Humans are accidental hosts.
Access to clean water and sanitation; regular deworming; use of closed footwear. Infection control in immunocompromised patients with hyperinfection. Immunocompromised patients who have been in endemic areas should be screened and treated if positive.
Sanitation to reduce contamination of vector snail habitat, together with mass treatment with praziquantel and health education.
Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, cases have decreased significantly. There were 1,292 reported cases in 2010, of which only 232 were in the endemic countries Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In endemic countries most cases are children aged <3 years. In 2009–2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus, notably hundreds of cases in Tajikistan. Most reported polio cases in 2010 (n 1,060) were in nonendemic countries. Polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in Chad, Angola, Sudan, and the DRC. This illustrates the difficulties of the global polio eradication program. Risk is seasonal in the temperate climates, with highest risks during the warmer months.
‘Classic’ trench fever is characterized by febrile attacks that last 1 to 3 days, with headache, shin pain, and dizziness. The attacks recur every 4 to 6 days, with succeeding attacks being less severe; no deaths have been reported. ‘Urban’ trench fever generally occurs generally in homeless people and clincal features are highly variable, including severe disease with endocarditis, non-specific symptoms with or without fever, and chronic asymptomatic bacteremia. Infection with B. quintana (or B. henselae) may also cause bacillary angiomatosis, usually in patients with HIV.
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, an enveloped RNA virus with three subtypes: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, an enveloped
Standard antitick precautions; avoidance of raw aquatic food from N. sennetsu endemic regions.
Minute hard ticks: Ixodes ricinus in Eurasia, possibly Hemaphysalis longicornisin Korea, I. ovatusin Japan. I. scapularis (formerly I. dammini) in eastern North America, possibly I. dentatus in the central USA, I. pacificus in California and Washington state, USA.
Reducing sexual transmission through the promotion ofmonogamy, condom use, male circumcision, and the detection and treatment of STIs; raising awareness of individual HIV status through voluntary counseling and testing; protecting IVDUs through needle/syringe exchange and methadone replacement programs; reducing mother to child transmission through voluntary counseling and testing and the provision of ARVs.
Foxes (including urban foxes) are the definitive hosts, wild rodents (mainly Arvicolidae), voles and lemmings are intermediate hosts. Foxes have extended their distribution into urban areas, partly due to a decrease in rabies deaths in foxes since rabies vaccination.
Small rodents (mice, voles, rats) and insectivores (shrews, hedgehogs) are the most common animal reservoirs of Borrelia, while larger animals (deer, livestock) serve as hosts for the tick vectors. Hares and birds may also serve as reservoirs. Ticks by trans-stadial transmission; transovarial transmission in ticks is limited.
Vector control; mosquito repellent; insecticidetreated bed nets; residual spraying of insecticides; treatment of infected humans. Recently control measures are being upscaled in a malaria elimination effort. Morocco, United Arab Emirates, and Turkmenistan have been certified malaria free by WHO.
Hantaviruses, a large group of different, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense viruses with a tripartite RNA genome, that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. Hantaviruses are named after the Hantan River area in South Korea, where the first hantavirus (Hantaan) was isolated in the 1970s. Old World and New World hantaviruses share high similarity in their genome and have comparable life cycles. Currently, there is no consensus on the classification of hantaviruses. Old World hantaviruses shown on the map are: Dobrava–Belgrade virus (DOBV), Hantaan virus (HTNV), Puumula virus (PUUV), and Saaremaa virus (SAAV). Seoul virus (SEOV) is not shown, it is world wide in major port cities.
Unknown. It has been proposed that bamboo rats may amplify infectious dispersal stages for human infections.
As mosquito vectors and wildlife reservoirs are widespread, control is not feasible; personal anti-mosquito measures; eliminating potential breeding sites (e.g. old tires) and filling of basal tree-holes with concrete.
By consumption of infected raw, salted, marinated, pickled or undercooked freshwater crabs and crayfish. Infected humans can excrete worm eggs in sputum and feces for up to 20 years. There is no person-to-person transmission.
It is endemic in tropical and subtropical climates, such as Papua New Guinea, South Africa, parts of India and Indonesia, and among the aborigines of Australia. Some cases have been reported in the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean. The disease may be related more to socioeconomic conditions than to racial or geographical factors. In some settings it is a common cause of chronic genital ulcers in HIV patients. In the USA, it is more common in African-Americans, of people in lower socioeconomic status, and those with poor hygiene. It has been hypothesized that the natural habitat of K. granulomatis is the intestine and that the skin is affected by direct contact during anal coitus, or indirectly through contamination of the genitals by fecal material. There is no gender difference in incidence; most cases occur in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years. There are no reports of congenital infections, but cases have been reported in newborn and nursing babies; the course of the disease is more aggressive during gestation. Donovanosis increases the risk of subsequent HIV infection.
Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) using reduced osmolarity ORS; intravenous rehydration in severe cases. Antibiotics are only useful to prevent spread, as they do not affect the already released toxin.
Infected individuals shed bacteria into environment, contaminating water and food products that are subsequently ingested by other humans.
Human infection is associated with cold waters in the northern hemisphere. A 2005 estimate stated that 20 million people were infected world wide. It is common in communities, as in Japan, that have a habit of eating raw or undercooked fish. Risky fish dishes are sushi, sashimi, South American ceviche, fish carpaccio, salmon tartare, and salted or marinated fillets in Scandinavia or Baltic region. Historically, Finland and Alaska had a high disease prevalence, but this has decreased due to preventive measures. Women seem more at risk, probably due to being involved in meal preparation. The disease incidence is increasing in some countries such as Russia, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil. Cases are also reported from regions where diphyllobothriasis was expected to have been eliminated, such as Alpine lakes in Switzerland, northern Italy, and eastern France. It is not clear whether the cases reported in Hawaii and Brazil are autochthonous or from imported fish. D. nihonkaiense, present in Japan and far eastern Russia, has been reported from a patient who ate raw Pacific sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from British Columbia, Canada. D. pacificum (formerly D. arctocephalinum) is increasingly reported as a human parasite along the coast of South America. Infected fish can be transported to any part of the world for consumption.
Bartonella quintana (formerly Rochalimaea quintana and Rickettsia quintana), a fastidious intracellular Gram-negative bacterium.
Recovery of S. pneumoniae from sputum, blood, CSF or other normally sterile fluids by culture or PCR. S. pneumoniae antigen test in urine.
Anti-mosquito precautions.
This is unknown at present. M. ulcerans has been found in biofilms on vegetation in swamps and other permanent wetlands, aquatic insects, snails, and fish. In Australia, some land animals, particularly native possums, have been found to carry M. ulcerans in their gastrointestinal tracts.
