SARS is thought to have emerged in Guangdong Province , China , in November 2002 and within 6 months cases were detected in 26 countries , with local transmission occurring in 6 . In total over 8,000 cases and almost 800 deaths were recorded and , remarkably , much of the global transmission of SARS can be traced to a single individual who disseminated infection at a hotel in Hong Kong . ` Super spreading ' events -LRB- where one person infects an unusually large number of people -RRB- , such as occurred at the Hong Kong Hotel , appear to be an important feature of SARS epidemiology . The precise circumstances and timing of the interspecies transfer of SARS-CoV remains unknown . Many of the early cases in Guangdong had epidemiological links to the wild animal trade but later the transmission of SARS was exclusively person-to-person with a large nosocomial element . Laboratory-accident associated cases in late 2003 and April 2004 , and a cluster linked to the wild animal trade in January 2004 , highlight the potential for the re-emergence of SARS .

HIV was first recognized clinically in 1981 . As of 2009 , over 25 million people are estimated to have died from HIV and around 33 million people are living with HIV . HIV epidemics are categorized into ` low-level ' -LRB- HIV prevalence < 1 % in the general population and < 5 % in vulnerable group such as MSM , injecting drug users , sex workers -RRB- ; ` concentrated ' -LRB- HIV prevalence < 1 % in the general population but > 5 % in at least one vulnerable group -RRB- ; and ` generalized ' -LRB- HIV prevalence > 1 % in the general population -RRB- . The greatest burden of HIV continues to fall on Sub-Saharan Africa , with 68 % of all people living with HIV and 72 % of all HIV-related deaths in 2009 . The epidemic in Africa is , however , heterogeneous , with high-prevalence generalized epidemics in Southern African countries ; generalized but moderate prevalence epidemics in Central , East and West Africa , and low-level epidemics in North Africa .

JEV is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia : 35,000 to 50,000 cases are reported annually but this believed to be a significant underestimate of the true disease burden . 20 -- 30 % die and 30 -- 50 % of survivors have neurologic or psychiatric sequelae . It is epidemic in temperate parts of Asia , linked to the seasonal occurrence of mosquitoes , and endemic in tropical regions of Asia due to the year-round mosquito activity . Intensification and expansion of irrigated rice production systems in South and Southeast Asia over the past 20 years have had an important impact on the disease burden caused by Japanese encephalitis , since the vectors breed in rice fields . The vectors prefer non-human hosts , but do feed on humans in periods of peak activity . The disease is mainly seen in children under the age of 15 and the elderly , since most adults are immune from earlier infection ; peak age is 3 -- 5 years . The range of JE virus has recently expanded into the Torres Strait of northern Australia , but the disease is rare in western Pacific islands .

Polysaccharide vaccines against A , C , Y , and W135 are available . These vaccines are safe and effective in adults and older children but are poorly immunogenic in children under the age of 2 and the duration of protection is limited to 3 -- 5 years . The development of a group C conjugated meningococcal vaccine that is effective in children under the age of 2 years has been an important advance , and conjugate vaccines are now available for A , C , Y , and W135 . The development of a group B vaccine remains a challenge . Chemoprophylaxis of close contacts eradicates carriage and reduces the incidence of secondary cases . Vaccination of household contacts may also prevent further cases .

Parotitis is present in 95 % of clinical cases . Infection and inflammation of the testicles -LRB- orchitis -RRB- occurs in up to 30 % of adult males but is rare before puberty . Orchitis results in testicular atrophy in 50 % of cases but rarely causes sterility . Adult women may rarely suffer inflammation of the ovaries -LRB- oophoritis -RRB- . The commonest nervous system manifestation of mumps infection is meningitis , which is seen in up to 10 % of cases but is self-limiting and does not result in death of disability . Other rarer clinical complications include hearing loss , encephalitis , and pancreatitis . Mumps infection in early pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion .
WHO estimates that 50,000 to 70,000 people are infected each year , with about 60 million people at risk in 36 countries . The disease distribution is limited by the range of the tsetse fly vector . Cases outside the tsetse fly distribution are likely imported . The disease distribution is patchy , with discrete foci and little to no disease between these foci . It is a disease of poverty and mainly occurs in remote rural areas . African trypanosomiasis was close to eradication through a variety of control programs , a loosening of these control programs caused the disease to reemerge in the 1980s . However , recent disease control programs are reversing this trend . The chronic gambiense form in West and Central Africa accounts for 95 % of cases and is seperated from rhodesiense by the Great Rift Valley . Uganda is the sole country reporting both forms , with rhodesiense in the south and gambiense in the northwest .
Food-borne trematodiasis is focal and occurs in areas where the snail and freshwater fish -- that is consumed raw or undercooked -- coexist . The disease is the leading cause of cholangiocarcinoma in the world . O. viverrini is common in Southeast Asia in the Mekong region with 8 million infected in Thailand and 2 million in Laos . In Thailand about 8.7 % of the population is infected and mainly in the northern provinces . Control activities in Thailand were able to reduce the prevalence from 34 % to 10 % in several areas . No data is available for Cambodia , China , or Vietnam , although opisthorchiasis is likely common there . O. felineus is found in Europe and northern Asia with approximately 5 million infected . Infected fish can be shipped and consumed in non-endemic areas .

All age groups can be infected , though BUNV mainly affects children . BUNV is particularly active in the riverine forests in Nigeria and CAR . 100 % of adults living in tropical rainforest of the DRC are seropositive . Neutralizing antibody rates of over 50 % for ILEV have been found in people in savannah areas of Nigeria . Lower seroprevalences of ILEV are found in rainforests . GERV is endemic in southern African countries . To date , GERV has not been reported to be responsible for any major human disease outbreaks , and is therefore considered of minor public health importance .
By mosquito bite -LRB- Anopheles spp . -RRB- . Transmission has been described in needle sharing IVDUs and through blood transfusion .
Fever , fatigue , anorexia , abdominal discomfort , nausea , vomiting , myalgia , jaundice , dark urine , and light stools . Arthritis and rash may occur . Disease may be mild and short-lived -LRB- several weeks -RRB- to severe and prolonged -LRB- months -RRB- , with a CFR < 0.3 % .
Mainly presents as a dry skin lesion that is covered with a crust and is smaller than the classic wet leishmania skin lesions in the New World . Lesions may persist for months or years . Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis may be seen with L. aethiopica ; leishmaniasis recidivans may be seen with L. tropica . Mucosal leishmaniasis is rare in the Old World , and more common in the Americas .
During bloodmeal , the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes . The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut , and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding . In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes .
Self-limiting disease .
Contamination of wounds with soil , dust or animal feces that contain C. tetani spores . Puncture wounds are most commonly associated with tetanus but it can result from even minor abrasions . Through injection of contaminated street drugs . Neonatal tetanus results from infection of the umbilical cord , either through the use of unclean instruments to cut the cord or through dressing the stump with contaminated materials .
Percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids -LRB- e.g. semen , vaginal fluid , saliva -RRB- of an infected individual . Person-to-person transmission via sexual contact , needle sharing in IVDUs , sharing toothbrushes or razors , and blood transfusion . Transmission does not occur via kissing , coughing , or sneezing . Mother to child transmission occurs mainly during birth or transplacentally -LRB- not via breastfeeding -RRB- .
For mild cases , an oral triazole ; for severe cases , amphotericin B followed by an oral triazole for at least a year .
Oropouche fever , fevre de Mojui .
Personal anti-mosquito precautions ; vector control ; screening blood and transplant products . There is no vaccine approved for human use . There are several veterinary vaccines .
Pertussis immunization has been successful in reducing the burden of pertussis disease and deaths , with around 150,000 cases reported in 2008 compared to almost 2 million cases in 1980 . However , these figures must be interpreted with great caution since reporting is mostly based on clinical diagnosis , whichis not easyin neonates , older children , and adults . The WHO estimated that nearly 18 million cases and 254,000 deaths occurred in 2004 , of which 90 % were in developing countries . Although pertussis disease has clearly been reduced by immunization , it is not clear to what extent immunization has reduced circulation of B. pertussis . The continued risk of pertussis in unimmunized infants and the persistence of epidemic cycles indicate that B. pertussis transmission continues despite vaccination programs . Several developed countries with high coverage in children have experienced outbreaks of pertussis in adolescents and adults . Immunity following natural pertussis infection or vaccination is not permanent , therefore high coverage with pertussis vaccines in children has shifted susceptibility and peak incidence to adolescents and young adults ; these age groups are then transmitting infection to young infants . Since pertussis in adults usually manifests as only a prolonged cough it is difficult to identify cases and protect infants .
Microscopy of infected tissue in which typical intracellular yeast cells are found ; culture of blood , bone marrow , skin lesion , or lymph node .
Infective larvae migrate out of the mouth part of the fly during bite onto the skin and subsequently enter the wound . The tabanid bite is painful with blood loss .
Supportive , including rehydration . Avoid aspirin because of potential hemorrhage .
Zika virus , an enveloped RNA flavivirus ; closely related to Spondweni virus .
Ebola or Marburg hemorrhagic fever .
Zika virus fever .
Cysticerosis has a worldwide distribution , mainly where pigs are consumed and sanitation is substandard -LRB- see Streptococcus suis map for pig density and Sanitation map -RRB- . In endemic countries it is an important cause of epilepsy , causing a high disease burden in mainly poor families . In several countries neurocysticercosis is the cause of 10 -- 50 % of seizures . Neurocysticercosis is common in Latin America and non-Muslim African and Asian countries where pig is eaten and traditional pig rearing is practiced . Regions with the habit of eating raw or undercooked pig meat are at increased risk . In Europe , cysticercosis has largely disappeared due to strong health system and good sanitation . In several developed nations , like the USA and Spain , there is an increase in certain regions where lots of migrants live who have come from high endemic countries . Tapeworm carriers can cause small outbreaks , as was observed in a Jewish community in New York that employed cooks from Latin America .
Intestinal capillariasis , Pudoc mystery disease , wasting disease .
There are only about 5,000 cases of RRV and usually only a few hundred cases of BFV annually . Peak incidence is in the 30 -- 40 year age group , the disease is rare in children . RRV disease is the most common arboviral disease in Aus tralia , accounting for about 90 % of cases , often occurring in mixed epidemics with BFV disease on mainland Australia -LRB- to which BFV is restricted -RRB- . Most BFV cases occur in Queensland and are only sporadic . RRV cases have been reported from the island of New Guinea and caused epidemics in Pacific islands in 1979 -- 1980 . Transmission occurs year-round , especially in coastal northern and northeastern Australia , but is more intense during the mosquito season in most of the country . Birds are presumed to be involved in spread around Australia ; a viremic tourist from Australia is believed to have introduced the eastern topotype of RRV to the Pacific islands . Detailed epidemiological data is available on line at : http://www9.health.gov.au/cda/ source/cda-index . cfm .
Hares , hedgehogs , wild mice , livestock , ostriches . Since hard ticks overwinter and can pass the virus transovarially , ticks also serve as reservoirs .
By inhalation of aerosols from dried rodent excreta . Person-to-person transmission has not been reported .
Must be done in BSL-4 facilities if samples contain infectious virus . IgM ELISA , RT-PCR and virus isolation can be used on acute specimens ; in convalescence , antibody tests ; on autopsy specimens , electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry .
The principal clinical feature of tetanus is painful skeletal muscle spasms and rigidity . Three clinical forms are recognized . The commonest is generalized tetanus , which usually begins with spasms of the facial muscles and spreads in a descending pattern . On presentation patients commonly have ` lockjaw ' -LRB- trismus -RRB- , neck stiffness , difficulty swallowing , and abdominal rigidity . Generalized spasms may result in an arched posture -LRB- opisthotonus -RRB- . Other symptoms include elevated temperature , blood pressure , and sweating . Localized tetanus presents as localized spasms of muscles around the entry wound . Cephalic tetanus is rare and results from infection in the head and neck , and affects cranial nerves .
Humans .
Taeniosis : detection of eggs in stool by microscopy ; T. solium eggs can not be distinguished from T. saginata eggs ; serology ; Neurocysticercosis : histology ; CT or MRI scan brain ; serology is not sensitive or specific for neurocysticercosis .
Fever , vomiting , and watery diarrhea , and signs of dehydration in severe cases -LRB- mainly in young children -RRB- . In adults the disease is often subclinical . Symptoms last for about one week .
Infections are generally asymptomatic to mild . WEE can present as an influenza-like illness with sudden onset fever , severe headache , chills , and myalgia . Other symptoms are : retro-orbital pain , nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea . The disease can progress to more severe disease with encephalitis and death . Encephalitis occurs in about 13 % of infected cases . Absence of a rash distinguishes it from dengue and Mayaro fevers . Younger children with WEE are more severely affected neurologically and fatally . About 30 % of infants develop serious neurologic sequelae . The overall CFR for WEE is 3 -- 7 % .
Ebola viruses : possibly fruit bats , unknown for BDBV , SUDV , and TAFV ; Marburg viruses : infectious MARV and RAVV have been isolated from Egyptian fruit bats ; ` Cuevaviruses ' : Schreiber 's long-fingered bats .
Serology : IgM capture ELISA on serum or CSF ; antibodies can be detected in CSF after 4 days of disease onset , and in serum after 7 days . Virus isolation or viral RNA detection by RT-PCR are insensitive .
Control deer population ; avoid areas with ticks ; tick bite precautions : cover skin , repellent on skin and clothing -LRB- permethrin , DEET -RRB- , check daily for attached ticks and remove .
None .
Cholera is a common cause of epidemic diarrhea throughout the developing world . There are an estimated 3 to 5million cholera cases and 100,000 to 130,000 deaths due to cholera each year . The disease is endemic on the Indian subcontinent , Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa . It has a seasonal pattern with one or two peaks corresponding to the warm season . Areas with overcrowding and poor sanitation such as slums , refugee camps , and regions with political conflicts are at high risk for cholera outbreaks . Natural disasters -LRB- e.g. flooding -RRB- can be followed by cholera outbreaks due to disruption of the sanitation system -LRB- see Natural Disasters map -RRB- . In 2010 , a severe cholera epidemic was introduced into Haiti by human activity from a distant geographic source . Cholera was absent from Haiti for at least 100 years . Cases have also been detected in Florida and the Dominican Republic . Current-circulating V. cholerae strains are of the O1 and O139 serotype . Cholera caused by O1 strains of the El Tor biotype occurs world wide . The O1 classical biotype is confined to Bangladesh . In India , some recently isolated strains display characteristics of both the classical and El Tor biotype . Since 1992 , the O139 serotype has caused cholera in Bangladesh and India . Other serotypes of toxin-producing Vibrio cholerae -LRB- e.g. O141 and O75 -RRB- have caused severe diarrhea in patients who consumed seafood from the Gulf Coast of the USA .
None .
Rats are the main host species involved in human rat bite fever for both agents . The main location for S. moniliformis in rats is the pharynx . S. minusis mainly present in the blood and tongue of rats and salivary glands of mice . Other rodent species such as mouse , squirrel , and gerbil -- and non-rodent species -- have occasionally been identified as possible sources of infection . The rat population is estimated to be 10 billion , which is one-third of the total global mammalian population .

By inhalation of aerosols from dried rodent excreta -LRB- this is unlike other Bunyaviruses that are generally arthropod-borne -RRB- . Person-to-person transmission has been reported for ANDV .
Hookworm morbidity is higher in patients infected with large numbers of adult parasites . Attachment of the hookworm to the intestinal mucosa results in loss of blood , eventually resulting in anemia and malnutrition in chronic cases . Chronic hookworm infection can impair cognitive and growth development in children .
Female blackflies -LRB- Simulium -RRB- . Transmission by S. damnosum complex in Africa is responsible for > 95 % onchocerciasis cases . S. neavei complex in East Africa and S. rasyani in Yemen . In Latin America : Female blackflies -LRB- Simulium -RRB- . Transmission by S. damnosum complex in Africa is responsible for > 95 % onchocerciasis cases . S. neavei complex in East Africa and
By mosquito bite . There is no direct person-toperson transmission documented , and no evidence of congenital transmission .
The majority of infections are subclinical -LRB- 95 % -RRB- . Those with disease have mild fever , maculopapular rash often involving the palms and soles , which may be hemorrhagic and may recur , polyarthritis of both large and small joints , occasionally swollen extremities , anorexia , and lymphadenopathy . The disease is more severe in Scandinavia and South Africa than elsewhere . The disease is non-fatal , but moderate residual pain and stiffness in the joints may persist for years .
Sudden onset of fever , chills , malaise , myalgia , and headache , followed by pharyngitis , vomiting , diarrhea , and a maculopapular rash . Severe cases have internal and external hemorrhages , CNS involvement and multi-organ failure leading to terminal shock . The case fatality rate -LRB- CFR -RRB- varies , depending on location , virus involved , and clinical care : 0 % for RESTV and TAFV , 34 % for BDBV ; 78 % for EBOV , 53 % for SUDV , 82 % for MARV . Recovery may be prolonged and accompanied by long term sequelae , particularly hearing loss . Filoviruses can persist for months and disease may recur .
Endoscopic removal of larvae ; albendazole ; surgery for complications . Allergic patients : symptomatic treatment .
Hygiene ; access to clean water ; sanitation -LRB- see Water and Sanitation map -RRB- . A vaccine has been developed and proven effective , but is not yet available .
Not completely understood -LRB- see ` Transmission ' -RRB- .
Eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies , mature in about 2 to 3 weeks , depending on water temperature , and hatch ciliated larvae -LRB- coracidia -RRB- . Coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans -LRB- copepods -RRB- . The copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host , typically small fish . The larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae . Larger predator fish -LRB- e.g. pike , burbot , perch -RRB- ingest the smaller infected fish upon which the plerocercoid larvae migrate to the flesh of these larger fish that serve as third intermediate hosts harboring larvae . Humans and larger mammals acquire the disease by eating these larger fish raw or undercooked . The larvae mature into adult tapeworms that attach to the small intestinal wall by scolex and develop eggfilled proglottids that detach . Up to 1 million eggs per day per worm are passed in the feces , 2 -- 6 weeks after infection .
SARS presents initially with fever , headache , myalgia , and a non-productive cough that may progress to dyspnoea with pulmonary infiltrations on chest x-ray . Gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present in early SARS illness . Case fatality is around 10 % , and is higher in older adults than in children and young adults .
Fever and signs of meningitis -LRB- headache , vomiting , neck stiffness , intolerance of light , and decreased level of consciousness -RRB- . Hearing loss , generally permanent , in around 50 % of those infected . Arthritis , pneumonia , and fatal toxic shock syndrome are possible complications .

Marked cervical lymphadenitis distinguishes it from chikungunya infection . Hemorrhagic signs have not been seen . Recovery is complete , without sequelae .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment .
Humans .
Echinococcosis is restricted to the northern hemisphere , and is most commonly found in adults . The distribution of infected foxes is highly uneven ; sandy soils , dry habitats and large forests are unfavorable for the parasite . In Europe , foxes have adapted well to urban life and urban fox densities now can exceed rural fox densities . However , there is no clear correlation between fox densities and cases of human alveolar echinococcosis . In some areas there is a shift from a sylvatic to a synantropic cycle , including domestic dogs , as was seen in China and Alaska . Such a shift leads to a higher risk of infection in humans . The prevalence in dogs and cats is still very low in Europe , even in areas highly endemic for infection in foxes .

Brucella melitensis , B. abortus , B. suis , and B. canis , intracellular Gram-negative bacilli .
Sudden onset of fever , chills , headaches , body aches , sore throat , vomiting and nausea . Bubonic plague is most common , producing swollen , painful and eventually suppurating lymph nodes -LRB- buboes -RRB- which are usually inguinal . In the septicemic form , Y. pestis spreads through the bloodstream usually affecting the lungs , ending in fatal endotoxic shock and DIC . The CFR of the bubonic form is 40 -- 70 % ; of pneumonic and septicemic plague in the absence of prompt treatment , nearly 100 % .
Non-human primates in Africa and humansin Asia ; Asianmonkeys can be infected , but do not seem to constitute an important reservoir . During intra-epidemic periods , several vertebrates have been implicated as potential reservoirs .
HEV is more prevalent in areas with hot climates and poor sanitation . Outbreaks are more common during heavy rainfall and flooding , which leads to fecal contamination of the drinking water . Food-borne outbreaks also occur , especially with contaminated shellfish . HEV genotypes have their own geographic distribution . HEV-1 is common in high endemic areas of Asia and Africa . HEV-2 can be found in Mexico andWest Africa . HEV-3 has been found in rare cases in the USA and several developed countries in Europe , Japan , Australia , New Zealand , Korea , and Argentina . HEV-4 causes sporadic human cases in Southeast Asia and Japan . HEV-3 and HEV-4 are also reported in pigs on all continents , causing sporadic disease in humans .
Forest rodents , marsupials , and bats .
Virus isolation , RT-PCR , serology . Both viruses are BSL-4 agents .
The louse-borne agent is responsible for epidemics , with a CFR of 30 -- 70 % ; tick-borne agents cause endemic disease , with a CFR of 2 -- 10 % . LBRF has disappeared from Europe ; tick-borne relapsing fever is found world wide , except in Australia and New Zealand , and is rare in Europe and North America . Human TBRF is frequent in endemic areas where people live in close proximity to burrows of reservoir animals . Otherwise , the disease is sporadic . LBRF is now found sporadically in epidemics in Africa , and is associated with refugee camps , natural disasters , and famine . LBRF used to be common world wide with large epidemics during the two world wars . It may re-establish anywhere in louse-infested human populations .
Larva currens .
Avoid contact with armadillos or their habitat .

O. felineus : fever and hepatitis-like symptoms in the acute stage -LRB- right upper quadrant abdominal pain , nausea , and emesis -RRB- . Chronic symptoms : biliary tract obstruction , inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tract , liver abscesses , pancreatitis , and suppurative cholangitis .
Falciparum malaria , malaria tropica , tropical fever , blackwater fever , paludism , marsh fever .
An estimated 200,000 yellow fever cases occur annually with 30,000 deaths . The disease is present in the jungles of South America and in the jungles and Savannahs of Sub-Saharan Africa . On both continents it is endemic in various species of forest monkey , transmitted among them by mosquito bite . The disease is more common in West Africa as compared to East Africa . In Africa , mainly children acquire infection as older persons have acquired immunity . In South America , yellow fever is mainly an occupational disease of men who work in forests and can carry the infection back home , causing urban epidemics . The yellow fever virus is thought to have originated in Africa and to have been carried to the Americas in slave ships . Due to the relatively recent introduction -LRB- about 500 years ago -RRB- in the Americas , the virus has not yet adapted to the reservoir , explaining why South American monkeys become diseased , but not African monkeys . All countries with urban dengue are at risk of the introduction of yellow fever , including Asia and Australasia , because the vector is the same -LRB- see Aedes egypti and Aedes albopictus map -RRB- . Why Asia has remained free from yellow fever is not understood .
Cough , rhinorrhea , sore throat , malaise , and fever can develop when the worms move through the lungs . In about 5 to 14 days the larvae reach the central nervous system , leading to subacute meningitis . Eosinophilic meningitisis defined asmeningitiswith > 10 eosinophils/mL in CSF or at least 10 % eosinophils in the total CSF leukocyte count . Some caseshavelow-grade fever and temporary facial paralysis . Signs of raised intracranial pressure , like diplopia .

Recovery of bacteria from the cerebrospinal fluid , blood or fluid from arthritic joints ; culture ; PCR . Streptococcus suis is often misidentified as another streptococcus species and therefore underdiagnosed .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment .
None .
Flies contribute to the spread of ocular serovars of C. trachomatis .
The primary vectors are ticks and biting flies -LRB- deer flies , tabanids -RRB- . In central Europe : Dermacentor reticulatus and Ixodes ricinus are important vectors . In eastern USA , D. variabilis is the most important vector . In western USA , biting flies are the predominant vectors in arid regions . In Russia , transmission is both by ticks -LRB- Ixodes -RRB- and mosquitoes .
Most infections with S. stercoralis are asymptomatic . Symptoms may include : upper abdominal pain ; cough ; diarrhea ; a red and painful , creeping urticarial eruption on the skin ; and vomiting . Pulmonary symptoms -LRB- including Loeffler syndrome -RRB- can occur . Disseminated strongyloidiasis occurs in immunocompromised patients and presents with abdominal pain , distension , shock , pulmonary and neurologic complications , and septicemia . High mortality rates -LRB- 15 -- 87 % -RRB- have been described in patients with disseminated disease .
WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 . Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds . Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999 , WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world . Since the introduction to northeast America , the virus has spread to most regions in North America , Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and several cases in South America . The national average annual incidence of neuroinvasive disease in the USA during 1999 to 2008 was 0.40 per 100,000 population -LRB- range : 0.01 -- 1.02 -RRB- . In that time period in the USA , 28,961 cases were confirmed , including 1,131 deaths . Neuroinvasive disease incidence is higher among males , especially among persons aged 60 years . The highest incidence of neuroinvasive disease occurredin theWest Central and Mountain regions , probably resulting from the high efficiency of Cx . tarsalis as both an epizootic and epidemic WNV vector in those areas . Most US cases occur in the late summer , when Culex mosquitoes are more active and after WNV amplification in the bird reservoir . In warm climates year-round transmission is seen .
Cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis -LRB- CL -RRB- : Espundia , Uta , Chiclero ulcer , forest yaws .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment .
Wading birds -LRB- Ardeidae -RRB- and domestic pigs which amplify the virus asymptomatically ; mosquitoes by transovarial transmission and possibly overwintering adults .
Humans and non-human primates are the main reservoirs .
Contact with infected animal tissue . Cutaneous anthrax : direct skin inoculation during processing of contaminated animal hides , hair , wool , or animal hide products . Gastro-intestinal -LRB- GI -RRB- anthrax : Contact with infected animal tissue . Cutaneous anthrax : direct skin inoculation during processing of contaminated animal hides , hair , wool , or animal hide products .
The natural reservoir is unclear . The fungus can be isolated from nine-banded armadillos -LRB- Dasypus novemcinctus -RRB- . The disease has also been reported in dogs and other animals . Culturing the fungus from soil is difficult and regularly negative . As armadillos have close contact with soil , it is expected that soil is a reservoir . By using ninebanded armadillos as sentinel animals , it has been shown that the habitat of P. brasiliensis is likely humid vegetation close to water sources .
Classically meningococcal meningitis presents with fever , headache , neck stiffness , photophobia , nausea , and vomiting . In infants and young children the clinical picture may be non-specific . If the patient also has meningococcal bacteremia , a hemorrhagic skin rash may be seen .
Sudden onset fever and cough . Other early symptoms include : myalgia , headache , vomiting , diarrhea , nausea , and epigastric pain . The disease rapidly progresses to severe viral pneumonia . Patients may present with encephalitis or gastroenteritis . The CFR is around 60 % .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment .
Fox -- rodent -- fox -LRB- sylvatic cycle -RRB- . Foxes are the definitive hosts of the adult worm . Eggs are excreted with the feces and ingested by humans or the intermediate rodent host , where they hatch . The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and via the blood they reach the liver , lungs , brain , and heart . There they form metacestodes in which protoscolices develop . When the rodent is eaten by the definitive host , these attach to the small intestine and grow into adult worms . Occasionally wild carnivores -LRB- e.g. coyotes or wolves -RRB- can be definitive hosts . In some rural areas there is a synanthropic cycle in which dogs or cats are definitive hosts , acquiring the parasite from wild rodents .
By mosquito bite . There is no direct person-toperson transmission .
In the USA , an average of only 6 neuroinvasive cases of EEE are reported annually . The annual number of cases has declined in recent years . Incidence is similar among different age groups and ethnicities , but it is twice as high among men . Persons aged over 50 and under 15 are at greatest risk for developing severe disease . In North America , outbreaks occur during the mosquito season . In tropical South America transmission to horses is year-round , but human cases are rare . Culiseta breeds in swampy areas in woodland , transmitting the virus from marsh-nesting birds to horses kept in such areas ; unvaccinated horses often die . Outbreaks in Mexico and islands of the Caribbean have all been due to the North American subtype , indicating spread by migratory birds . South American strains are distinct and of three different lineages , probably determined by the range of different rodent hosts . Only a single human case has been reported from Brazil , and none from Guatemala , Belize , Colombia , Ecuador Peru , Cuba , or Trinidad and Tobago in spite of detection of the virus in mosquitoes or horses in those countries . The virus has also been isolated from horses in eastern Canada .
Thorough cooking of crustaceans , sanitary disposal of sputum and feces and use of molluscicides .
Supportive . Cidofovir has proven anti-monkeypox viral activity in vitro and in animal studies , but its efficacy in patients is unknown , neither is any benefit from treatment with vaccinia immune globulin known .
Ingested E. histolytica non-motile cysts will excyst in the gastrointestinal tract and develop to motile trophozoites that can penetrate the gut mucosa . In the colon , the trophozoites encyst and the cysts are excreted with the feces .
For LBRF , Borrelia recurrentis , a Gram-negative spirochete . For TBRF , at least 15 Borrelia species , each specific to a particular species of tick vector . Since the 1980s , the number of new Borrelia species associated with relapsing fever has increased , in part due to improved diagnostics .
Infection is often asymptomatic but as the adult worms live for 5 -- 10 years , some will develop painful swelling -LRB- sometimes enormous -RRB- of legs or arms , and , in cases of Bancroftian filariasis , the breasts or scrotum -LRB- hydrocele -RRB- . Up to 40 % have renal involvement . Acute cases may have high fever , recurrent lymphadenitis , and retrograde lymphangitis .
Virus isolation from stool , CSF or oropharyngeal secretion , followed by typing -LRB- to determine if the virus is ` wild type ' or a vaccine strain -RRB- . Alternatively , the diagnosis can be established by serological testing .
Fecal -- oral route , mainly exposure to food or water contaminated with infectious cysts . Direct human-to-human transmission occurs via oral and anal sexual activities .
Gram stain and microscopy of cerebrospinal fluid , and culture . Latex agglutination tests for detection of group-specific capsular polysaccharide . PCR .
In Africa , isolated from Aedes africanus , Ae . apicoargenteus , Ae . luteocephalus , Ae . aegypti , Ae . vittatus , and Ae . furcifer mosquitoes ; probably Ae . hensilii on Yap island .
During blood meal , the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes . The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut , and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding . In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes .
Freshwater operculate snails -LRB- mainly Parafossarulus sp . and Bithynia sp . -RRB- .

Tick-small mammals and birds-tick ; large mammals are necessary to maintain tick populations . Humans and lizards are dead-end hosts .
Access to clean water and sanitation ; protective clothing for occupational risk ; after accidental exposure , dry the skin and apply 70 % alcohol ; mollusciciding ; avoid contact with contaminated water bodies .
Chagas disease .
Sudden onset fever -LRB- may be diphasic -RRB- , headache , myalgia , arthralgia , anorexia , dizziness , chills , and photophobia . Also nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , epigastric and eye pain , conjunctivitis , and meningitis have been reported . Recently , spontaneous hemorrhagic phenomena were reported in human cases . The disease is self-limiting , there are no reports of OROV related deaths .
Wild birds . Over 100 bird species can be infected by WNV infection . Many birds get infected and amplify the virus but do not die . The robin is probably the main amplifying host , and rarely has overt disease . American crows , blue jays , and hawks are susceptible to death . The number WNV bird deaths can predict subsequent disease severity in humans and equines .
Human .
Early diagnosis and treatment ; safe sexual practices -LRB- condom use -RRB- . Proper bodily hygiene .
For meningitis or septicemia , prompt treatmentwith appropriate antibiotics -LRB- penicillin , ceftriaxon -RRB- will lead to recovery . Specific organ involvement like the heart , requires specialist treatment . Early treatment with dexamethason can reduce the risk of hearing loss .
Respiratory droplets from people with respiratory diptheria , or from asyumptomatic throat or nasal carriers . Direct contact with discharge from the skin of cutaneous diphteria cases . People recovering from diphtheria may carry the organism in the nasopharynx for weeks . Rarely from contaminated items . In the past , outbreaks have been linked to consumption of contaminated raw milk .

During VEEV outbreaks , Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus is often the main vector in coastal regions . Epizootic/epidemic subtypes of VEEV are transmitted by mosquitoes of many different genera .
Vector control ; mosquito repellent ; insecticidetreated bed nets ; treatment of infected humans .
Primary HIV infection is usually a nonspecific illness with fever , headache , myalgia , fatigue , and a sore throat . Generalized lymphadenopathy and a maculopapular rash may occur . Following primary infection there is a prolonged asymptomatic period before the appearance of the clinical manifestations of a loss of immune control over infectious pathogens and cancers . Common presenting AIDS defining illnesses are tuberculosis , atypical mycobacterial infections , recurrent bacterial infections , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia , candidiasis , Kaposi sarcoma , lymphoma , cryptococcal meningitis , and CMV disease .
Benznidazole , pentamidine , melarsoprol , eflornithine , suramin , and nifurtimox are effective in acute cases ; melarprosol and eflornithine can have SAEs . Patients need to be followed up for 1 -- 2 years .
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex , including M. tuberculosis , M. africanum , M. canetti , and M. bovis , slow growing acid-fast rods . M. bovis is not discussed further .
Infections are most frequent in a period of drought and winds -LRB- dust storms -RRB- after heavy rains that advance mold growth , usually late summer or early fall . It is estimated that more than 150,000 primary infections occur annually in the USA . Incidence in California and Arizona appears to have increased since 1991 and again since 2001 , probably driven by immigration of non-immunes andwheather conditions that favor dissemination of the fungus . Prevalence of infection in northern Mexico is reported to be 10 -- 40 % . Male gender , African-American and Filipino race/ethnicity , immunosuppression , diabetes , older age and pregnancy are risk factors for chronic and disseminated disease . Infections outside the western hemisphere are extremely rare and primarily imported .
Oroya fever , Carri√≥n disease , verruga peruana -LRB- Peruvian wart -RRB- .
Hepatitis B is a common disease world wide , despite the existence of a vaccine . The WHO estimates that globally 2 billion individuals have been infected , of which about 360 million have chronic disease . Yearly , it is estimated that there are 500,000 to 700,000 HBV associated deaths world wide . In high-endemic regions like Southeast Asia , Africa , and the Amazon basin , most individuals become infected during childhood -LRB- mother-to-child , or child-to-child -RRB- . In developed regions , the prevalence is low and important routes of transmission are different , consisting mostly of unsafe sexual practices , IVDU , and occupational transmission in healthcare workers . Chronic HBV associated liver cirrhosis is more common in developed nations than in Southeast Asia , but the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is lower compared to Southeast Asia . It is not yet fully clear whether this is due to differences in HBV genotype or age of infection .
Rotavirus antigen detection by EIA and other serological techniques ; RT-PCR .
Cancrum oris , gangrenous stomatitis
Soil with high nitrogen content , particularly areas with a lot of bird or bat guano , like barns and caves . Blackbird roosts can also be heavily contaminated . Unlike bats , birds are not infected by H. capsulatum and do not excrete the fungus in their droppings . Bird droppings are considered a nutrient source for fungal growth in the already contaminated soil .
Lockjaw .
Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a Gram-positive , aerobic rod that is classified into three potentially toxigenic biotypes , intermedius , mitis , and gravis . Toxin producing strains of C. diphtheriae carry a bacteriophage-derived tox gene . Toxinproducing strains of C. ulcerans may also cause respiratory diphtheria .
Detection of Donovan bodies in cytodiagnostic or histopathologic examination -LRB- may be absent when pretreated with antibiotics -RRB- ; histology is similar to that of rhinoscleroma ; PCR .
Rat bite fever is a rare and underreported disease with a worldwide distribution . S. minus infection is reported less frequently than S. moniliformis and occurs mainly in Asia , particularly Japan . World wide , millions of people are bitten by animals each year and rats are responsible for about 1 % of these bites . It is estimated that 2 % of rat bites lead to an infection -LRB- all causes -RRB- . It is unknown what the proportion of rat bite fever is of these infections . The relation between humans and animals is changing which may alter the epidemiology of rat bite fever . Rats have become a pet in several countries , while it used to be considered a pest . Children handling pet rats may be a special risk group . More than half of the reported cases of rat bite fever occur in children .
Above 95 % cure rate with a single dose triclabendazole . Albendazole or praziquantel are not effective .
By tick bite ; rarely by blood transfusion and transplacental/perinatal . Ticks must feed for more than 24 hours for transmission to occur .
Early stage disease : suramin for T. b. rhodesiense , pentamidine forT . b. gambiense ; Late stage disease : melarsoprol for both forms ; eflornithine with or without nifurtimox for gambiense . These drugs can cause SAEs .
Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disease that can affect the skin , heart , nervous system and , less commonly , the eyes , kidneys , and liver . Often there is an annular skin rash that develops at the bite site , known as EM . After several months , approximately 60 % of patients with untreated infection will have intermittent arthritis . Up to 5 % of untreated patients develop chronic neurological complaints months to years after infection . Re-infection can occur .
Mosquito bite . There is no direct person-toperson transmission .
Japanese B encephalitis .
Microfilariae ingested by the fly develop in about 7 days into infective L3 stages and migrate to the head and escape into the skin during feeding . In the subcutaneous tissues the L3 larvae moult into L4 stages and produce nodules within which they develop in 10 months into adult filariae and can live there for 14 -- 15 years . The female worms can produce microfilariae for 10 years . Microfilariae are typically found in the skin , skin lymphatics , and ocular tissues . They have a lifespan of up to 2 years . Humans remain infectious for about 10 years , the time the female worm remains fertile , bur reinfection occurs in endemic areas .
Mebendazole or albendazole with adjunctive corticosteroids . Lumbar puncture relieves the headache . Ocular infection requires surgery .
Humans are the natural host . Numerous mammals have serologic evidence of HEV disease , including but not limited to : pigs , cattle , sheep , goats , horses , macaques , cats , dogs , rabbits , mongoose , deer , wild boar , rats , and mice . HEV in pigs is asymptomatic , but there is transient viremia and excretion of virus into the environment .
Bilharziasis , snail fever , Katayama fever or syndrome , intestinal schistosomiasis .
Herbivores become infected when they ingest spores during grazing on contaminated soil . When the animal dies , the soil under the carcase is contaminated . Omnivores and carnivores are infected by feeding on infected prey or carcases . Carnivores and humans are incidental hosts .
Supportive only . Human immunoglobulin has been given to pregnant women exposed to rubella and infected with rubella in an attempt to prevent infection or CRS , but its efficacy is not proven .
Endemic treponematoses is now rarely reported since the eradication campaign . Complete eradication may have been achieved if surveillance was continued and rural healthcare services improved . Disease foci still exist , but reports are lacking . Several nations fail to report to avoid the stigma of ` being backward . ' The WHO has estimated that 2.5 million people are still infected with endemic treponemes , and about 460,000 are actively infectious . The disease primarily afflicts children in tropical and subtropical areas . The distribution of endemic treponematoses is patchy and associated with poverty and poor access to social and healthcare services ; it thus affects mainly rural communities in developing countries -LRB- see Human Development map -RRB- . Endemic syphilis generally affects individuals in hot , arid climates , and yaws affects those in hot and humid areas . Pinta is found only in Central and South America , but has not been reported for over 40 years . No endemic syphilis cases have been reported since the 1980s . Yaws is also rare and currentlyis only reported from foci in West Africa and Indonesia . Also , no new yaws cases have been reported in India since 2004 . It has been suggested that the presence of non-venereal treponematoses indicates that the country or region has a poor-quality healthcare system .
Not completely understood . Possibly in the soil the fungus produces infective propagula that can become airborne , inhaled , and lead to respiratory infection . Infections may also occur through traumatic lesions , but this has not been demonstrated .
Oral commensal bacteria such as Fusobacterium necrophorum , F. nucleatum and a spirochete -LRB- formerly identified as Borrelia vincenti -RRB- are the suspected etiological agents .
By mosquito bite . Transfused red cells , platelets , and fresh-frozen plasma from infected donors can transmit WNV ; transmission has also been reported more rarely through organ transplantation , blood transfusion , and mother-to-child . Laboratory infections have occurred from aerosols and percutaneous exposures .
Microscopy of stained thick blood smears taken around noon ; membrane filtration ; PCR . Eosinophilia and high IgE levels are indicators of active infection .
Hard ticks -LRB- Ixodidae -RRB- . The brown dog tick -LRB- Rhipicephalus sanguineus -RRB- , the principal vector of MSF , ISF , ITT , and AF , is most active during spring and summer , has a low human affinity , and prefers dogs in a peridomestic environment . The southern African bont tick -LRB- Amblyomma hebraeum -RRB- and A. africanum are the principal vectors of R. africae in southern Africa . A. hebraeum is an aggressive , human-biting tick and has high rates of rickettsia infection , and ATBF cases therefore often occur in clusters . See key references for further reading on ticks and tick-borne rickettsioses .
It is estimated that 17 million people are infected world wide and 91 million are at risk of infection . F. hepatica is endemic on all continents but is of particular public health importance in the Andean countries -LRB- especially Peru and Bolivia -RRB- , Ecuador , Chile , Argentina , Brazil , Venezuela , Cuba , Mexico , the Islamic Republic of Iran , Egypt , Philippines , and western Europe -LRB- e.g. France , Portugal , and Spain -RRB- . Infections with F. gigantica are restricted to Africa and Asia . Both species of fluke overlap in many areas of Africa and Asia , whereas F. hepatica is the major concern in the Americas , Europe , and Oceania . The rural areas of the Andean region of Peru and Bolivia have prevalence rates of up to 68 % . Women are affected more than men , with higher prevalence rates , more severe infections , and more reported liver or biliary complications ; children are affected more than adults . The main source of infection is the consumption of raw vegetables contaminated with metacercariae , such as watercress , salads , and contaminated water from irrigation channels . Pharyngeal fascioliasis may occur after ingestion of raw goat or sheep liver -- a dish in some Middle Eastern countries .
Endemic syphilis -LRB- bejel , nonvenereal -RRB- syphilis , pinta -LRB- carate -RRB- , yaws -LRB- frambesia -RRB- , nonvenereal treponematosis .
Sindbis virus -LRB- SINV -RRB- , a single-stranded , positive sense , enveloped RNA alphavirus , with 5 genotypes : SIN I -LRB- European/African -RRB- , SIN II and III -LRB- Asian/Australian -RRB- , SIN IV -LRB- Azerbaijan/China -RRB- , and SIN V -LRB- New Zealand -RRB- . The first Sindbis virus isolated was cultured in 1952 from a mosquito near Sindbis village in the Nile Delta -LRB- Egypt -RRB- . Almost 10 years later the first human case was detected in Uganda in 1961 and in Europe in 1971 .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment .
Consumption of raw or undercooked infected freshwater fish , mainly Cyprinidae -LRB- carp and minnows -RRB- or shrimp .
Sanitation to avoid contamination of vector snail habitat with human or animal feces . Improve water drainage , use molluscicides and avoid eating uncooked aquatic plants in endemic areas and drinking untreated water .
Adult worm can be extracted by carefully and slowly winding the worm around a stick over a period of days . Metronidazole or thiabendazole can facilitate the extraction process , but should be used with caution .
Principally humans ; also warm-water marine and estuarine copepods , other zooplankton . Crabs , shrimps , and shellfish carry the vibrio on their carapaces and shells .
None .
RVFV primarily causes disease in animals in Africa and Middle East , with human cases occurring during animal epidemics . Humans that regularly work with animals -LRB- farmers , herders , veterinarians , slaughterhouse workers -RRB- are at increased risk of infection . Epidemics in animals occur when mosquito populations dramatically increase after periods of heavy rainfall or the production of wetlands behind man-made dams . RVF was initially confined to Sub-Saharan Africa , but appeared in Egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the Arabian Peninsula -LRB- Saudi Arabia and Yemen -RRB- in 2000 and later also on the Comoros Islands . As RVFV epidemics are closely associated with above-average rainfall , outbreaks can be forecasted upon which preventive measures can be implemented .
Depends on disease severity and type of disease . In areas with high penicillin resistance , ceftriaxone can be used for severe disease . In case of ceftriaxone resistance , vancomycin is used . For meningitis , dexamethasone is added to antibiotic treatment .
No proven treatment available .
Acute : hepatomegaly , prolonged fever , anorexia , weight loss , nausea , vomiting , cough , diarrhea , urticaria , lymphadenopathies , and arthralgias . Significant clinical improvement 3 -- 5 days after specific treatment is diagnostic . Chronic -LRB- which may be asymptomatic and last for more than 10 years -RRB- : biliary obstruction with upper abdominal pain , cholecystitis , cholangitis , and extrahepatic cholestasis . Liver fibrosis may be a complication of the infection .
Microscopy of stool specimens can not distinguish between E. histolytica , E. moshkovskii , and E. dispar ; PCR is able to distinguish between these species ; stool antigen tests can identify E. histolytica .
Wild , migratory birds of the order Passeriformes -LRB- mainlyfieldfare , redwing , and songthrush -RRB- and Anseriformes -LRB- ducks , geese and swans -RRB- . Tetraonid birds -LRB- grouse -RRB- population size changes coincide with SINV epidemics in Finland . Larger passerine species have higher prevalences of infection as compared to smaller species .
Occupational hygiene by the use of protective clothing and avoiding contaminated surface waters -LRB- difficult in case of flooding in developing countries -RRB- . Environmental control measures , like rodent and flood control , are difficult to implement . Chemoprophylaxis for adventure travelers , military personnel who visit endemic areas , and after an accidental lab exposure .
For interrupting transmission : mass treatment with a single dose of albendazole or ivermectin combined with diethylcarbamazine citrate -LRB- DEC -RRB- once a year for at least 5 years ; or the regular intake of DEC-fortified salt for at least one year ; individual treatment : DEC can worsen onchocercal eye disease and cause serious adversere actions in patients with loiasis . Pathogenicity of filarial nematodes is largely due to the immune response to their endosymbiotic Wolbachiabacteria , therefore doxycycline may be used . The treatment for hydrocele is surgery .
Search for ticks on the whole body daily and remove them without crushing . Use tick repellent on skin and an acaricide on clothing . There is no effective vaccine .
Yellow fever virus -LRB- YFV -RRB- is an enveloped singlestranded positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus . YFV is genetically more heterogeneous in Africa than in America , suggesting it originated in Africa .
Rickettsia rickettsii , R. parkeri and R. africae , Gramnegative intracellular bacilli . R. rickettsii is the agent of RMSF , R. parkeri causes a RMSF-like illness . R. africae causes African tick bite fever and is rarely found in the new world . New agents are still being discovered regularly .
Self-limiting conjunctivitis , including watery or mucopurulent discharge . Typical findings are lymphoid follicles and papillary hypertrophy . Repeated infections lead to scarring of the conjunctiva and trichiasis . Trichiasis damages the corneal surface , resulting in keratitis , vascularization of the cornea , and impaired defence against secondary bacterial and fungal infection . Corneal damage produces corneal scar , leading to blindness .
The most prevalent HTLV-1 clinical manifestations can be divided into those associated with ATL -LRB- immunosuppression -RRB- or associated with HAM/TSP -LRB- immunoactivation -RRB- . The HTLV-1-infected individual who immunologically tends to immunosuppression can develop opportunistic infections such as Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection , recurrent skin infections and ATL . The HTLV-1infected individual who tends to immunoactivation can develop HTLV-associated uveitis , polymyositis , inclusion body myositis , arthritis , pulmonary infiltrative pneumonitis , Sjogren syndrome and HAM/TSP .
Repeated re-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis serovars A , B , Ba , and C , an obligate intracellular bacterium . The genital serovars D to K can infect the conjunctiva , but generally do not lead to blindness as they cause self-limited infections that typically do not recur .
Two or more doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine are necessary for protection . Global coverage with three doses of a pertussis-containing vaccine are shown elsewhere -LRB- see DTP3 map -RRB- . Infants under the age of 3 -- 5 months are , depending on the vaccination schedule , too young to have received two doses and are also vulnerable to complications of pertussis . This group therefore suffers the greatest burden of pertussis mortality . Post-exposure prophylaxis with a macrolide antibiotic may be recommended for contacts in households where there is a susceptible member -LRB- e.g. an infant -RRB- .
Ehrlichiosis occurs worldwide , principally following the distribution of the transmitting tick vectors and reservoir species . Less is known of the epidemiology and ecology of E. chaffeensis as compared to A. phagocytophilum . Most HME cases are reported in the south-central and eastern USA , where A. americanum reaches high population densities . Approximately 70 % of HME cases occur from May to July in the USA , corresponding to the peak feeding activity period of the ticks . HME is most commonly diagnosed in adults , with a male-to-female ratio of > 2:1 . Most HME cases are single and not clustered . Recreational or occupational activities in rural tick-infested habitats are at risk . Majority of the cases have a history of a tick bite . Ehrlichiosis is often not recognized in Africa , where the primary diagnostic focus is malaria and typhoid fever . Sennetsu fever occurs in Asian regions where the eating of raw fish is common , such as in Japan . N. sennetsu has been detected in the climbing perch in Laos , a fish common throughout the Mekong River , Basin . Climbing perch is widely distributed and eaten in Asia .
Contact with freshwater bodies containing cercariae that penetrate skin or mucous membranes ; drinking contaminated water -LRB- uncommon -RRB- .
Infective larvae in soil invade the skin ; A. duodenale larvae can also infect via oral ingestion .
The parasite isingested by a tsetse fly during feeding on an infected host , and enters the salivary glands after 12 -- 30 days , and can be transmitted to new susceptible hosts during the life of the fly -LRB- 3 months -RRB- . There is no vertical transmission in the fly .
Unknown .
Through wounds on the skin , including minor abrasions . Infection via ingestion of contaminated improperly cooked pork products . No human-to-human transmission .
Direct fecal -- oral transmission and via contaminated surfaces . Rotavirus has also been detected in repiratory secretions .
Leptospirosis has a worldwide distribution , is more common in tropical regions where it is both an occupational disease and a disease of ` daily lives , ' mainly during heavy rainfall . Most foci are found in Latin America and the Caribbean , India , Southeast Asia , Oceania , and eastern Europe . The agent favors warm , humid environments . The prevalence of different serovars depends on the reservoir in which animals are present , local environmental conditions , local occupation , and agricultural practices . Protective measures have decreased the occupational risk in high-risk jobs , like mining , sewermaintenance , farming , veterinary work , and the military . In the tropics , occupational exposures -LRB- rice and sugar cane farming , fishing -RRB- and other agricultural activities remain an important risk . Leptospirosis is an emerging disease in slums , especially during rainy seasons . Also large recreational events with water exposure can be an important source of big multinational outbreaks .

Healthy humans can carry S. pneumoniae in their upper respiratory tract .
Lice infestation -LRB- pediculosis -RRB- can be controlled by treating clothes and bedding with insecticides or boiling -LRB- bedding at shelters is a major source of lice infestation -RRB- . The body does not need to be deloused as the lice live and lay their eggs in clothes or bedding . Oral ivermectin has been effective in delousing homeless people .
Anisakidosis occurs world wide , mainly in coastal regions , and in cultures where consumption of raw fish occurs . Risky fish dishes are sushi , sashimi , Filipino bagoong , salted or smoked herring , gravlax , Hawaiian lomi-lomi and palu , South American ceviche , and Spanish pickled anchovies . Anisakidosis is increasingly common in western European countries and the USA due to the increasing popularity of eating raw fish -LRB- usually Sashimi -RRB- . In the USA most cases are related to Pacific salmon consumption and in Europe to herring consumption . It is unclear why anisakidosis is common in Japan , but rarely reported in Taiwan or coastal China where similar fish products are eaten . Overall there is underdiagnosis of the disease due to the physicians ' inexperience of the disease . Pseudoterranovosis -LRB- codworm -RRB- is relatively more common in North America than in Europe or Japan . Most allergic cases are reported from Mediterranean Europe . In Spain it is mainly related to the consumption of cooked hake and anchovies .
The tick feeds on an infected host , the virusmultipliesin the tick 's midgut and spreads to the salivary glands , to be injected into another host at the next feed , where it infects erythrocytes . As the virus infects erythrocytes , it is partially protected from immune clearance , leading to prolonged viremia in both humans -LRB- up to 4 months -RRB- and rodents , favoring spread .
Microscopy for eggs in stool smear -LRB- Kato -- Katz technique -RRB- is often inconclusive due to the similarity to eggs of other trematodes . Intradermal test is rapid and sensitive , but not specific . Immunodiagnosis is regarded supportive but not confirmatory . Radiology to demonstrate bile duct pathology . PCR test for O. viverrini is available .
Endoscopic identification of larvae . Eggs and larvae are not found in the feces . Specific antibody tests are available for anisakis-associated hypersensitivity .
Human -- sandfly -- human . Humans can be bacteremic for many months . Period of infectivity in the sandfly is unknown .
Penicillin for both forms of rat bite fever . Penicillin resistance in S. moniliformis is rare . Tetracycline in penicillinallergic patients .
Primary : BCG vaccination of children protects against disseminated disease . Secondary : intensive search for and treatment of source cases ; contact investigation and treatment of positive cases with chemoprophylaxis . WHO has established a ` Stop TB Partnership ' program to control TB world wide .
LBRF is not transmitted by the bite itself but by feces or louse gut fluid entering broken skin by scratching . TBRF : by bite or coxal fluid of infected ticks . Transmission may also occur through blood transfusion or transplacental ,
Hepatitis A virus -LRB- HAV -RRB- , a single stranded RNA virus , genus Hepatovirus in the family Picornaviridae .
Ecological characteristics of the ticks influence the epidemiology of tick-borne rickettsioses . In 1910 , the first case of Mediterranean spotted fever -LRB- MSF -RRB- R. conorii was considered to be the only agent of tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsioses in Europe and Africa . Similarly , R. sibirica was thought to be the only agent in Russia and China and R. australis in Australia . The reason for this was that diagnosis was made by serologic testing , which cross-reacts with other rickettsial species . Due to improved diagnostics , particularly molecular , the understanding of rickettsioses has increased , and new agents are being found regularly . Multiple distinct tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsioses are recognized . The name of the agent informs us where the agent was initially found , but most agents have a more widespread distribution .
Trench fever is named afterinfected soldiers in the trenches during World War I. Little data exist on the incidence and distribution of B. quintana infections . Infections have been reported from every continent . Trench fever is a sign of social turmoil and personal hardship . For instance , an epidemic of trench fever erupted in a refugee camp in Burundi . In Europe and North America , B. quintana infections are associated with poverty , alcoholism , and homelessness , known as urban trench fever . Crowded and unhygienic living conditions facilitate exposure of B. quintana infected individuals to lice that subsequently pass on the infection to others . Trench fever is a re-emerging disease due to the increase in homeless people and HIV-infected individuals .
Large trematode liver flukes living in blile ducts : Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica . F. hepatica is 20 to 30 mm long and F. gigantica can be up to 75 mm long .
Microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito , and develop in 2 weeks into larvae that enter the mouth-parts . Larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed . In humans , they travel via thelymphatics , when adults they form ` nests ' and produce microfilariae , which migrate to the blood and display periodicity coinciding with the peak vector biting times .
Cattle with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy .
Type B hepatitis , serum hepatitis , homologous serum jaundice , long-incubation hepatitis .
Mosquito bite . Direct person-to-person transmission has not been documented .
L. monocytogenes can be detected from blood and CSF by microscopy/culture or PCR . MRI is indicated for suspected brainstem infection -LRB- rhombencephalitis -RRB- . Serology is not useful for diagnosis .
Chloroquine is effective ; primaquine is likely unnecessary as a gametocidal drug since gametocytes appear to be sensitive to chloroquine .
Infection control hospitals ; safe injection practices by healthcare providers ; screening of blood products ; clean needle programs . HCV immunoglobulin is not effective . There is no vaccine .
Burkholderia pseudomallei , -LRB- formerly Pseudomonas pseudomallei -RRB- , an aerobic , motile Gram-negative bacillus of the beta-proteobacteria group . It is oxidase positive , resistant to a wide range of antibiotics including gentamicin , polymyxin , and the second-generation cephalosporins . A similar disease of equines called glanders , now rare -LRB- extinct in the Americas -RRB- , is caused by the related bacterium B. mallei . Both B. mallei and B. pseudomallei are listed as potential biological warfare agents .
Hendra virus and Nipah virus are negative-stranded RNA viruses , and comprise the Henipavirus genus within the family Paramyxoviridae . Hendra virus was discovered in horses and stable staff in Australia in 1994 , Nipah virus in pigs and pig farmers in the town Nipah , Malaysia , in 1999 .
Isolation and barrier nursing of cases ; discourage butchering of wildlife that died from unknown causes and burial practices of cases involving ritual embalming . Avoid bat-infested caves or mines in endemic areas .
The name means ` joint-breaker ' in the Acholi language of Africa .
Hard ticks , with Ixodes ricinus as the most important vector of the European subtype and I. persulcatus for the other subtypes .
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus -LRB- CCHFV -RRB- is an enveloped , spherical virus with a tripartite , singlestranded , negative sense RNA genome , belonging to the genus Nairovirusin the family Bunyaviridae . It has 7 genotypes distinguished by the small -LRB- S -RRB- segment of the RNA .
For C. philippinensis : eggs are passed in the stools of humans and fish-eating birds ; after ingestion by freshwater fish , larvae hatch , penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the tissues . Ingestion of raw or undercooked fish results in infection of the human and bird host . The adults of C. philippinensis reside in the mucosa of the human small intestine , where the females lay eggs . Released larvae can cause autoinfection , which may progress to hyperinfection .
IgM capture ELISA ; NS1 antigen test ; RTPCR of blood or tissue ; virus isolation in mosquitoes or mosquito cell culture with identification by IFA .
Contact with freshwater bodies containing cercariae that penetrate skin or mucous membranes ; drinking contaminated water -LRB- less common -RRB- .

North American blastomycosis , Gilchrist disease
Rodent control in and around dwellings ; infection control in hospitals , with barrier nursing and precautions to avoid contact with body fluids .
Mycobacterium leprae , a slow-growing , acid-fast , intracellular bacterium . It grows best at 27 -- 30 C , which explains the main target organs of M. leprae : skin , peripheral nerves , nasal mucosa , upper respiratory tract , and eyes .
Dengue virus -LRB- DENV -RRB- is an enveloped RNA virus , genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae . There are four antigenically related , but distinct , dengue virus serotypes -LRB- DEN-1 , DEN-2 , DEN-3 , and DEN-4 -RRB- , all of which can cause DF/DHF .
Often misidentified as P. malariae , but skilled microscopists are able to make the distinction . A relatively severe illness with a microscopic diagnosis of P. malariae should alert clinicians to the possibility of P. knowlesi because P. malariae malaria is almost invariably mild . Species can be confirmed by PCR if needed .
Blastomycosis is a sporadic disease with a worldwide distribution , though most cases are reported from North America . It is endemic in the Mississippi and Ohio river basins and around the Great Lakes . In endemic areas blastomycosis is frequent in dogs but rare in cats and other animals . The annual incidence of blastomycosis in northern Wisconsin is estimated to be 40 -- 100 per 100,000 in humans and 1,400 per 100,000 in dogs . In the USA outbreaks are usually seen in the spring and fall , indicating infection 1 -- 3 months earlier . Cases are commoner in males and the disease is rare in children . Blastomycosis occurs close to rivers and lakes with changing water levels . Activities involving shores or waterways , like fishing and canoeing , are identified as risk factors for infection .
There are an estimated 1,000 -- 3,000 human cases per year , but there is considerable underreporting and underdiagnosis . The last plague pandemic of 1894 started in Hong Kong establishing many endemic foci world wide . New foci continue to arise , as was seen in Algiers , in 2003 . Warm springs and wet summers have increased the plague prevalence in the great gerbil in Kazakhstan . Similar climatic conditions may have resulted in past plague pandemics . Infection control and antibiotics can decrease plague morbidity and mortality but plague can not be eradicated as it is widespread in wild rodents . There has been a large shift in case load from Asia to Africa , with more than 90 % of cases occurring in Africa . The most common form is bubonic plague , but outbreaks of pneumonic plague still occur . Plague is possibly more common in Africa as poor rural communities in Africa live in close proximity to rodents , which are widely hunted and eaten in plague-endemic areas .
Doxycycline for acute Q fever . Chronic Q fever endocarditis : a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine for approximately 18 months .
Classical pertussis has a prodromal stage of 1 -- 2 weeks with coryza and a mild , persistent cough that progresses to paroxysms of violent coughing interspersed with an inspiratory whoop . Vomiting may follow coughing bouts . This stage can last 4 -- 6 weeks . Adolescents and adults often do not have paroxysms and whooping , presenting more commonly with a prolonged cough . Asymptomatic infection may also occur . Infants under 6 months may present with apnea , and deaths occur mostly in this age group . Serious complications include pneumonia , seizures , cerebral hypoxia , and encephalopathy .
Freshwater snails : Biomphalaria spp . for S. mansoni , Bulinus spp . for S. haematobium , S. intercalatum , and S. guineensis . Technically , humans are the ` vector ' as they harbor the parasite 's sexual stage . Snails are intermediate hosts .
Listeriasis , listerellosis .
Usually asymptomatic or mild . Diarrhea alternating with constipation , vomiting and anorexia , edema of the face , abdominal wall and legs , ascites . Heavy worm loads may cause bowel obstruction . Eosinophilia , vitamin B12 deficiency , and secondary anemia may occur .
Listeria bacteria in the environment or food are ingested by ruminants and humans , colonize the intestine and shed again into the environment with the feces . L. monocytogenes is able to cross the intestinal mucosa under specific conditions , resulting in systemic disease or hematogeneous spread to the central nervous system and , in the case of pregnancy , fetus .
Food for canning or bottling should be thoroughly cooked ; consumption of inadequately smoked or salted food and uneviscerated fish should be avoided . Also avoid honey and dusty excavation sites with infants . A pentavalent botulinum toxoid -LRB- PBT -RRB- vaccine is available from the CDC .
Mosquito -- reservoir host -- mosquito . The mosquito becomes infected during feeding on a viremic reservoir host ; once the virus reaches the salivary glands it can be transmitted during feeding to the next reservoir host .
H. capsulatum grows in soil and material contaminated with bird or guano . The fungus has been found in poultry house litter , caves , areas harboring bats and in bird roosts . Histoplasma capsulatum is found throughout the world excluding areas of very low and very high rainfall . It is endemic in certain areas of the United States , particularly in states bordering the Ohio river valley and the lower Mississippi river , where 90 % of the population have positive histoplasmin skin tests , indicating a large amount of asymptomatic infection . H. capsulatum var . duboisii is common in caves in southern and East Africa . Infection can occur outside the cave entrance without entering . Infants , young children , and older persons , in particular those with chronic lung disease , are at increased risk for severe disease . Disseminated disease is more frequently seen in people with cancer , AIDS or other forms of immunosuppression .

The mites are infected by feeding on reservoir animals -LRB- small rodents -RRB- , and maintain the infection throughout their life stages . The infection is passed on by transovarial transmission . O. tsutsugamushi are present in the salivary glands of the larvae and injected into the host during feeding .
Approximately 150,000 to 200,000 patients with HFRS are hospitalized each year throughout the world , more than half of them in China . The main agent of HFRS in Asia is HTNV . SEOV is also an important cause , but has a wider distribution . The most prevalent hantaviral disease in western and central Europe is caused by PUUV , with > 9,000 cases per year . DOBV is restricted to the Balkans . Hantaviral disease is seasonal , linked to the activity of the rodent host . HFRS epidemics are associated with rodent abundance , caused by various seasonal factors . During the agricultural season , infection is linked to outdoor activities , and during the winter , rodents seek shelter in and around buildings and infection is contracted indoors . There have been reports of clinical hantaviral infections in the UK and there is serological evidence of human infection in Israel , Kuwait , Laos , Malaysia , Philippines , Thailand , and Vietnam and in several African nations .
Globally , there exist four patterns of HAV infection , based on age-specific HAV seroprevalence rates . High-endemic areas generally have low disease rates as most infections occur in young children , who are usually asymptomatic . Adults are immune and epidemics in these high-endemic areas are uncommon . High-endemic areas is defined as a region where > 90 % of the children < 10 years are already infected and most cases are asymptomatic . The high endemic areas are generally in poor regions with poor sanitation and lack of access to clean water -LRB- see Human Development Index map and Sanitation map -RRB- . Improving living conditions leads to intermediate endemicity , which causes high disease rates because more infections now occur in older people -LRB- as disease averted in children -RRB- , who are symptomatic . HAV epidemiology in high-endemic areas is shifting to intermediate endemicity , which results in an increase in disease burden . Large variations exist within countries in HAV incidence . In -LRB- very -RRB- low-endemic areas , children will not acquire the disease and the adult population will remain susceptible , leading to localized outbreaks . In areas of low endemicity , the overall prevalence is < 25 % . In developed countries with low endemicity , outbreaks are often caused by contaminated food products , like shellfish , which can concentrate virus , and other food products that are contaminated by an infected food handler .
Humans .
Since the end of 2003 the A/H5N1 virus has spread globally , infecting poultry in over 60 countries and causing the loss of over 250 million poultry . In 2010 HPAI H5N1 remained entrenched in poultry in several Asian countries and Egypt . While migratory waterfowl plays a role in the long-distance spread of H5N1 -LRB- see Bird Migration map -RRB- , the intensification of poultry farming and poorly regulated movement and trade in poultry is probably the most important factor in sustaining the current epizootic . HPAI H5N1 is highly contagious between birds and has a high fatality in most poultry species , making it an economically important disease . However , it is the risk to humans that has driven most of the control activities . Over 500 human cases have been detected in 15 countries . The concern remains that H5N1 may evolve or reassort with another influenza A virus to become either more transmissible from poultry to humans or transmissible from person to person .
Sudden onset fever , headache , malaise , anorexia , severe abdominal or lower back pain , often with nausea and vomiting , followed by hypotension which may progress to shock , hemorrhages and renal involvement , and death . Convalescence is prolonged . PUUV virus causes less severe disease . The CFR is 5 -- 15 % for HFRS ; for PUUV and SAAV infection the CFR is 1 % ; for DOBV the CFR is 9 -- 12 % . The differential diagnosis is leptospirosis or rickettsioses .
Supportive treatment ; ribavirin . Junin convalescent serum reduces the CFR of Argentinian hemorrhagic fever to < 1 % .
TB is a major cause of death and disability world wide , especially in developing countries . Morbidity and mortality rates increase with age , and are higher in males . In regions of high incidence , morbidity peaks in adults of working age . Morbidity is higher in urban populations , among the poor , and in closed institutions such as prisons and military barracks . There were an estimated 9.27 million incident cases of TB in the world in 2007 -LRB- 14 % HIV positive -RRB- , an almost 50 % increase from 1990 , and an estimated onethird of the world 's population is either latently or actively infected with TB . Most of the cases in 2007 were in Asia -LRB- 55 % -RRB- and Africa -LRB- 31 % -RRB- . MDR-TB is a serious problem in Russia , former Russian republics , India and China . In 2007 there were an estimated 0.5 million MDR-TB cases . By 2008 , 55 countries reported at least one XDR-TB case .

LFV was isolated from a missionary nurse living in Lassa , Nigeria , in 1969 . It is estimated there are 200,000 to 300,000 symptomatic Lassa fever cases in West Africa each year , with an associated mortality of 5,000 to 10,000 . Lassa fever occurs in two geographically distinct regions : the Mano River region -LRB- Guinea , Sierra Leone , Liberia -RRB- in the West , and Nigeria in the East . In the dry season , the multi-mammate rat gathers in houses , and in the rainy season , the rat forages in the surrounding fields . Villages with Lassa fever are all located in rain forest areas or transition zones of rainforest to savannah , where the mean annual rainfall is above 1,500 mm and below 3,000 mm . LFV can be transmitted from rodents to humans both in the rainy and the dry season . However , in the dry season there may be an increased risk for humans due to aggregation of the rats in their houses .
An estimated 7.6 million people are infected with T. cruzi and 75 million are at risk in Mexico , Central and South America , determined by the range of the vector . Originally American trypanosomiasis was a disease of agricultural workers -LRB- mainly adult men -RRB- living in rural areas in poor housing conditions . In urban areas transmission is mainly via blood transfusion , and occasionally via ingestion of contaminated sugarcane juice or palm fruit juice . Control programs between 1990 and 2006 resulted in the estimated annual number of deaths falling from more than 45,000 to 12,500 , and the incidence of new cases from an estimated 700,000 to 41,200 . Chronic cases are diagnosed in non-endemic countries in immigrants . In the USA 300,000 immigrants have Chagas disease , and an estimated 30,000 cases of Chagas cardiomyopathy annually .

MAYV is enzootic in the humid tropical rainforests of South America . Infections peak in the rainy season when the mosquito vectors are most abundant . Most human cases occur sporadically and involve persons who work or reside in humid tropical forest ; several small outbreaks of Mayaro fever have been described in residents of rural communities of the Amazon region of Brazil , Bolivia , and Peru . Travelers have imported MAYV from Surinam to the Netherlands and from Brazil into France . The virus has been detected in migratory birds .

Demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in Giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy ; PCR tests have been developed for the different Leishmania species ; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience . The Montenegro skin test is simple , sensitive and specific , but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections .
Pasteurization . Persons at high risk of infection should avoid high-risk foods -LRB- smoked fish , raw meat sausage , soft cheeses -RRB- and sufficiently heat foods -LRB- e.g. left-overs -RRB- , chemoprophylaxis can be given to susceptible persons at risk after exposure to contaminated food . The organism can replicate at refrigerator temperatures .
E. histolytica is distributed world wide , especially in countries with poor sanitation and little access to clean water -LRB- see Water and Sanitation maps -RRB- . It is estimated that E. histolytica is responsible for 40,000 to 100,000 deaths per year . Most prevalence studies in the past did not distinguish between E. histolytica and the non-pathogenic E. dispar , and therefore little is known of the current disease prevalence of the pathogenic E. histolytica . E. histolytica infection is endemic in Mexico , India , South Africa , some Central and South American countries , and Asian Pacific countries . Community-based studies in urban slums in Bangladesh showed that : 9 % of preschool children suffer from amebic diarrhea each year , with 2 % requiring a hospital visit . In developed countries , amebiasis is seen in travelers and immigrants from developing countries , and cases may also be found in closed psychiatric institutions . MSM are also a risk group , since they are more exposed .

Most infections produce few or no symptoms . Acute symptoms include variable fever , lymphadenopathy , malaise , and hepatosplenomegaly . The entry site may be inflamed for up to 8 weeks , and a diagnostic unilateral bipalpebral edema -LRB- Romana 's sign -RRB- appears in a few cases . After a latent period which may last 10 -- 30 years , chronic irreversible sequelae occur in 20 -- 30 % of cases : myocardial lesions with arrhythmia , often fatal , andlesions of the esophagus , colon , and peripheral nervous system . Variations in clinical presentations can be related to the strain involved . Group I T. cruzi , rare north of the Amazon region , produce cardiac but not digestive tract lesions . Group IIT . cruzi can produce both cardiac and digestive tract lesions . AIDS patients may develop meningoencephalopathy .

Colorado tick fever is only present in North America -LRB- USA and Canada -RRB- . In the USA , besides the states with human cases shown on the map , the virus has been isolated from ticks within the range of D. andersoni . The typical habitat of the tick and its rodent hosts is a south-facing slope above 1,500 meters with Ponderosa pine and shrubs on dry , rocky surfaces . Infection is seasonal , coinciding with the period of greatest tick activity in early summer . Human cases can be detected from March to September in the Rocky Mountain region , USA . Most human cases are males , aged 20 -- 29 years , probably reflecting the frequency of outdoor activity in the mountains .
Chikungunya means ` that which bends up ' in Makonde language , to describe the pain .
Snail -- human -- snail . Infected humans shed eggs into the water , which hatch into larvae -LRB- miracidia -RRB- that enter snails and develop into motile larvae -LRB- cercariae -RRB- . The cercariae are shed into the water and penetrate the skin of humans with water contact . Cercariae enter the bloodstream and settle in the liver , where they grow into adult male and female worms that migrate to the abdominal veins , mate , and produce eggs . Snails are infectious for up to 3 months , humans for 10 years or more .

CFR for VEE is < 1 % . VEEV infection may cause stillbirths .
The major endemic area is China , with an estimated 20 million people infected , followed by India , Laos , and Myanmar . In the Americas , Ecuador has an estimated 1.5 million cases , but up to 2010 only 9 autochthonous cases of paragonimiasis have been reported from North America -LRB- excluding 2 outbreaks in 2006 in California from eating raw freshwater crab imported from Japan -RRB- . In 1992 , the Chinese mitten crab from Korean and Chinese waters positive with Paragonimus eggs was found in western US waters .
RMSF and R. parkeri rickettsiosis are characterized by fever , myalgia , malaise , headache , and a maculopapular eruption that can involve the palms or soles . R. parkeri rickettsiosis is milder than RMSF , and often does not require hospitalization . RMSF cases may progress and develop stupor , delirium , ataxia , or coma ; RMSF CFR is about 7 % . Untreated RMSF is often progressive with a CFR of 20 % , which is not the case for untreated R. parkeri rickettsiosis . Most -LRB- > 90 % -RRB- R. parkeri cases have an eschar , which is rare in RMSF . GI symptoms are common in RMSF and rare in R. parkeri disease .
Demonstration of Strongyloides larvae on repeated stool specimens by microscopy after concentration -LRB- coproculture or Baermann -RRB- . Stool examination has poor sensitivity , particularly in chronic cases . Serological tests vary in sensitivity and specificity , and perform better in chronic cases and are therefore used for screening patients at risk for hyperinfection . PCR has higher sensitivity than microscopy . Hyperinfection : larvae or parasite DNA can be found in sputum and other specimens .
Bunyamwera encephalitis , Bunyamwera viral disease , Cache Valley encephalitis .
OROV was first isolated in Trinidiad in 1955 . In South America , cases are limited to Trinidad , Panama , and the Amazon basin . Oropouche fever is , after dengue fever , the most common arboviral infection in Brazil . The virus has periodically caused large urban epidemics in Brazil and Peru , during which up to 60 % of the population has been affected . There also outbreaks in villages and sporadic cases . Approximately 500,000 cases have occurred in Brazil since the 1960s . There are three OROV genotypes circulating in Brazil : genotypes I and II in the Amazon Basin and genotype III in the Southeast Region . Genotype III has been isolated from a marmoset -LRB- Callithrix species -RRB- in southeastern Brazil , and also occurs in Panama . Outbreaks coincide with periods of highest rainfall , when biting midge density is greatest . OROV infections are likely underdiagnosed in South America as was seen during a concurrent outbreak of dengue virus and OROV in Manus -LRB- Brazil -RRB- , where OROV infections were missed by physicians and the Public Health Authority .

Bartonellosis due to B. bacilliformis was originally restricted to high , dry mountain valleys from 600 to 3,200 meters in the Andes of Colombia , Ecuador and Peru . Since 1997 it has expanded geographically to the Utcubamba river valley , Cusco , La Libertad and the low-lying hills below 600 meters in coastal Ecuador . The cause for this expansion is unknown . The disease incidence is increasing in Peru , particularly in children . In endemic areas attack rates of 12.7 / 100 person-years are found , with highest rates in children under 5 . There is a decreasing incidence with increasing age due to acquired immunity . For each year of age , the risk of infection diminishes by 4 % . Most cases cluster , with 70 % occurring in only 18 % of households in the community where the outbreak happens .

An estimated 650 million people are at risk in 10 provinces of China . The distribution is closely correlated with the habit of consuming raw terrestrial molluscs , reptiles , or amphibians . The majority of cases are in adults , except in Taiwan where most cases are in children . Pomacea canaliculata , a snail native to South America , was imported into Taiwan in 1981 as a food source and then into mainland China . It has replaced A. fulica as the main intermediate host of A. cantonensis and has become the main source of human infection in Taiwan and mainland China . Depending on the region , up to 70 % of P. canaliculata can be infected . Eating raw frogs also lead to human infections in China , and the USA . Consumption of lizards caused several cases in Thailand , Sri Lanka , and India . Cases have been seen in at least five countries in Europe and New Zealand in travelers returning from endemic regions . Malnutrition and debilitating diseases can exacerbate the infection .
By contact with the excretions , or materials contaminated with the excretions , of an infected rodent , such as ingestion of contaminated food or by direct contact of abraded or broken skin with rodent excrement . Infection can also occur by inhalation of minute particles soiled with rodent urine or saliva -LRB- aerosol transmission -RRB- .

Fecal -- oral route , mainly via fecally contaminated water , but also via : food , materno-fetal , and transfusion of blood products . Direct person-to-person transmission is uncommon . Cycle : Human to human and occasionally animal to human . HEV is excreted from the liver into the stool via the bile and eventually into the environment . The amount of infectious virus in the stool is relatively low and explains a lower rate of transmission as compared to hepatitis A -LRB- see Hepatitis A map -RRB- .
Blood feeding reduviid bugs of the genera Triatoma , Rhodnius , and Panstrongylus . The most common vector in south America is Triatoma infestans . The vector lives up to 2 years .
By bite or direct percutaneous contact , mucosal or respiratory exposure to blood , tissues , fluids or lesions of infected animals . In Africa , transmission mainly occurs through butchering infected wildlife for food . Person-to-person transmission probably occurs through direct contact with infected tissue/fluid , respiratory droplet spread , and indirect via contaminated objects .

VIH , SIDA , slim disease , acquired immune deficiency syndrome -LRB- AIDS -RRB- .
S. pneumoniae is an important cause of severe pneumonia , meningitis , and sepsis in children and adults . Risk factors for severe disease are : older age -LRB- > 65 years -RRB- , diabetes , chronic disease -LRB- heart , lung , kidney , liver -RRB- , alcoholism , cancer , HIV , non-functioning or absent spleen , and sickle cell disease . A global burden of disease study estimated that in 2000 about 14.5 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease occurred world wide , leading to about 826,000 deaths in children < 5 years . The most common presentation of severe disease is pneumonia . The majority of deaths -LRB- 95 % -RRB- occurred in Africa and Asia . Since 2000 the pneumococcal vaccine has been introduced , mostly in developed countries , while developing countries need themmost . In 2008 , 24 high-income and two middle-income countries had pneumococcal vaccination in their program , accounting for less than 0.2 % of childhood pneumococcal deaths in 2000 . Many deaths in low-income countries are due to poor healthcare infrastructure and inadequate treatment options . Penicillin and chloramphenicol are still widely used to treat meningitis despite high resistance levels against these agents in some areas . Vaccination and access to proper treatment are needed in Africa and Asia . Interventions should be targeted on countries with large populations and moderate incidence , and countries with high incidence and mortality .

Infant botulism is the most common form of botulism in the USA and is caused by growth of spores germinating the immature gut of infants and releasing the toxin , or rarely in adults with abnormal intestinal tracts . Honey is a common source , but in 85 % of infants , the source is unknown . Infant cases occur from 6 days to 12 months of age and affect equally both sexes . Food-borne botulism is the result of eating fermented , salted , or smoked fish , seafood or meat that has not been cured for long enough to eliminate contamination . It is also due to incorrect home canning or bottling of vegetables or fruit . Botulism usually occurs in outbreaks in those exposed to the same food . The largest numer of reported cases per country over the decade 2000 -- 2009 in ProMED mail have occurred in Thailand -LRB- 83 cases from deer meat , 163 from bamboo shoots -RRB- , Poland -LRB- 276 from preserved food -RRB- , and Georgia -LRB- 217 from home-preserved -- vegetables -RRB- . Food-borne botulism outbreaks occur in indigenous tribes in Alaska and Canada by consuming improperly preserved fish products -LRB- seal , salmon , salmon eggs -RRB- . Wound botulism results from failure to remove contaminated soil completely from wounds and sealing them , permitting anaerobic growth of the bacteria . Inadvertent botulism is a recent phenomenon resulting from the use of diluted Botulinum toxin to treat patients for several disorders and for cosmetic reasons .
Multiple species of the spirochetal genus , including Leptospira interrogans , which is the species associated withmost severe disease . There are currently 8 species found to be pathogenic for humans , associated with > 250 serovars belonging to the pathogenic species . Antigenically related serovars are grouped into 24 serogroups . A single serovar may belong to different Leptospira species .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment . Ribavirin may limit the severity and improve the prognosis of LACV infections . Anticonvulsant medication in those with seizures .
A large number of infective mosquito bites are necessary to establish infection .
Before 2004 , CHIKV was considered a minor arboviral disease , but since then has spread globally , infecting millions of people . Most cases are symptomatic . CHIKV has been endemic in Africa for centuries , typically causing small epidemics in rural areas . CHIKV spread to Asia within the last 60 years producing urban outbreaks , similar to dengue fever , involving Ae . egypti . The global epidemic started since a mutation in the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein gene -LRB- A226V -RRB- occurred , that enhanced its infectivity and transmission by Ae . albopictus . The mutated CHIKV is succesful in spreading in tropical and temperate regions where Ae . albopictus is present . In 2005 -- 2006 CHIKV spread from East Africa to virgin soil in the Indian Ocean Islands to produce epidemics affecting up to three-quarters of the population . Since 2006 , CHIKV outbreaks with are reported from several -LRB- sub -RRB- tropical countries in the new world . CHIKV virus was imported into several European countries and caused a small outbreak with autochthonous transmission in northern Italy . CHIKV-viremic travelers can cause autochthonous transmission in previous CHIKV-free areas if Ae . albopictus or other competent mosquitoes are present .
The global number of hookworm disease cases is estimated to be 740 million individuals , with the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Asia . The majority -LRB- 85 % -RRB- of the hookworm infections are caused by Necator americanus , which is the predominant hookworm of Latin America , the Caribbean , Sub-Saharan Africa , and Southeast Asia . There is strong association between hookworm prevalence and poverty -LRB- see Human Development map -RRB- . The remaining 15 % infections by Ancylostoma duodenale are in focal pockets in India , especially around Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal , and in China north of the Yangtze river . Mixed infections may also occur . Hookworm disease prevalence rises with age and plateaus in adults . Disease is more prevalent where individuals walk barefoot in regions lacking sanitation -LRB- see Sanitation map -RRB- . Hookworm larvae prefer sandy soil in mild humid climates , resulting that individuals living in coastal areas have the highest infection intensity .
River blindness , onchodermatitis .
There is little known about the epidemiology of these viruses . Group C viruses are geograpically limited to the tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas , and were first described in the Brazilian Amazon in the 1950s . Studies show that these viruses circulate in a compact ecosystem in which co-infection with more than one virus is possible in reservoir hosts , leading to genetic reassortment . Genetic analysis shows evidence of intense traffic of these viruses in the Americas . Nepuyo virus has the widest distribution reported , from Mexico to Brazil . There is no sex or age preference for infection . Inapparent and mild infections are common , overt disease is mostly seen in children residing in endemic areas .
The mosquito becomes infected with MAYV during feeding on a viremic host . The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the mosquito . After a few days , depending on the ambient temperature , the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding .
By mosquito bite .
Community management by SAFE strategy -LRB- see above -RRB- . The WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma -LRB- GET 2020 -RRB- seeks to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020 .

Infection may be asymptomatic or progressive and fatal , if untreated . Onset is often insidious . Common symptoms include fever , malaise , weight loss , and sweats . Cough may be prominent . Symptoms can come and go . Splenomegaly , hepatomegaly , and lymphadenopathy are common findings . HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk for symptomatic infection . Bacterial co-infections , including tuberculosis , may occur . Anemia , leucopenia , and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory findings .
By bite of an infected phlebotomine sandfly .
HCV infection has a worldwide prevalence of 2 % and an estimated 130 to 170 million chronic cases globally . The highest prevalences are found in Africa and Asia . Egypt has the highest HCV prevalence rate -LRB- 22 % -RRB- , likely due to a national schistosomiasis treatment campaign since the 1960s that re-used needles . In developing countries the high prevalence is likely due to poor infection control practices in the healthcare system -LRB- therapeutic injections , blood transfusion , surgery -RRB- . Also local practices in the community , like acupuncture and cutting of the skin with unsterile knives , are other important routes of transmission . In Asia it is common to receive injections for various illnesses outside the hospital setting . In developed countries HCV is mainly transmitted by IVDU , accounting for 70 -- 80 % of HCV infections .
Pigs ; occasionally found in wild boar , horses , dogs , cats , and birds . Asymptomatic pigs typically carry the bacteria in their tonsils .
Direct person-to-person transmission between close contacts by droplet spread or direct oral contact ; through objects contaminated with respiratory secretions .
Avoid eating raw slugs , snails , other molluscs , freshwater prawns , land crabs , and uncooked vegetables grown in ponds -LRB- e.g. watercress -RRB- from endemic areas.Washing of vegetables does not guarantee absence from larval contamination . Boil snails and crustaceans for 5 minutes or freeze at 15 C for 24 hours .
None .
Humans .
In 2000 , WHO started the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis that aims to interrupt transmission and reduce morbidity . Endemic areas are mapped with subsequent mass treatment for the population at-risk -LRB- see Therapy -RRB- for 5 years . Care needs to be taken in loiasis endemic areas to prevent adverse events -LRB- see Loiasis map -RRB- ; vector control -LRB- e.g. bed nets , repellent -RRB- .

Praziquantel ; surgery in case of biliary obstruction .
Microscopy for eggs on stool samples by the Kato -- Katz or rapid sedimentation techniques -LRB- RSTs -RRB- are diagnostic for the chronic infection . Serological tests -LRB- Fas2ELISA -RRB- is recommended for acute infection . The intradermal test is rapid and sensitive , but as it is not sufficiently specific it is no longer used . Radiology , such as computed tomography , can demonstrate liver lesions -LRB- only in acute infection -RRB- similar to metatastic lesions . For chronic infections , a cholangiogram can detect bile duct pathology caused by the adult parasites .
Personal anti-tick precautions . An inactivated mouse-brain vaccine is in use in Russia and eastern Europe . Healthcare workers caring for CCHF patients are at risk and need to take proper barrier precautions .
Streptomycin is recommended , with gentamicin as an alternative . Tetracyclines may be used for less severe cases .
Common in tropical and subtropical areas world wide among people who go barefoot , endemic between 30 N and 15 S of the equator . Mycetoma is endemic in areas with a short rainy season of relatively low rainfall and a temperature range of 30 -- 37 C , followed by a long dry season with low relative humidity temperatures ranging from a night-time low of as little as 15 C to a daytime maximum of up to 60 C . This extreme alteration in weather conditions might be necessary to the survival of the causative organism in its natural niche in soil or plant material . Cases have been exported from the endemic region to many nonendemic countries . World wide , about 60 % of cases are caused by actinomycetes ; the rest are caused by fungi . In Africa , eumycetomas are more frequently observed than actinomycetomas ; in India , actinomycetes are found in more than half of the cases reported . In South America , 90 % of the cases are caused by actinomycetes . Infection is most often seen in herdsmen , farmers , and other field laborers . Males are 4 -- 5 times more often affected than females , even in areas where both sexes spend a lot of time in the fields . Mycetoma is seen in all age groups , but usuallyin adults 20 -- 40 years old . The disease progresses faster in HIVpositive and other immunocompromised patients .
Combination of atovaquone and azithromycin for mild-to-moderate illness , clindamycin and quinine for severe disease . Exchange transfusion for life-threatening infection , dialysis in case of renal failure . Chloroquine is ineffective .
Various vaccines are available ; personal antimosquito precautions ; intermittent irrigation of rice fields disrupts vector breeding ; vaccination of pigs reduces amplification .

For C. philippinensis : sanitation and avoid consumption of raw or improperly cooked fish .
Ebola viruses , except RESTV , are endemic in the tropical rain forests of equatorial Africa . Most outbreaks started from a single case admitted to a hospital that had inadequate infection control , resulting in rapid nosocomial transmission . Cases have been imported from endemic countries into South Africa and Switzerland , and laboratory infections have occurred in the UK and Russia . Marburg viruses are endemic in arid woodlands of equatorial Africa . Outbreaks are usually limited to a few cases , with the exception of one outbreak in the DRC and Angola . Cases have been imported into South Africa , the Netherlands , and possibly the USA . A laboratory outbreak in 1967 in Germany and in Yugoslavia , led to the discovery of the disease -LRB- not shown on the map -RRB- .
Amphotericin B is recommended for severe cases . Itraconazole for milder cases .
Sandfly control with residual insecticide ; avoid endemic areas after sunset ; use insect repellents and covering clothes ; insecticide-treated bednets . Active case finding in households where cases occur . Vector-control efforts should target the homes of incident case patients . Patients should be kept in sandfly-proof wards .
Each virus is associated with either one or a few closely related species of rodents , which constitute the virus 's natural reservoir . Tacaribe complex viruses in the New World are generally associated with rats and mice -LRB- family Muridae , subfamily Sigmodontinae -RRB- . The reservoir rodents are chronically infected , and the virus is transmitted among them , leading to lifelong viremia and virus excretion , and they do not die . The reservoir for Junin virus is Calomys musculinus and C. laucha , for Machupo virus , C. callosus , for Guanarito virus Zygodontomys brevicauda , and for Whitewater Arroyo virus Neotoma albigula . For Sabia and Chapare viruses the reservoir host is unknown .

Vaccination of people at high risk -LRB- veterinarians , animal rescue personnel , laboratory staff , etc. -RRB- , avoid contact with stray dogs or cats , sick or dead wildlife ; vaccinate all dogs and cats ; distribute baits containing oral vaccine in wildlife habitat ; quarantine dogs arriving from infected countries . Culling of stray dogs is ineffective ; sterilization prevents replacement breeding .
Cysticercosis develops after ingesting T. solium eggs ; Taeniasis -LRB- tapeworm carriage -RRB- occurs after ingestion of raw or undercooked pork meat with cysticerci ; human to human transmission is by the feco -- oral route .
Principally sylvatic rodents ; also marsupials , bats , and shore birds may be involved in the enzootic virus cycle .
Standard anti-mosquito precautions .
Virus detection in blood or tissue by culture or RT-PCR ; serology -LRB- IgM ELISA , IFA -RRB- . Virus isolation should be done in a BSL-4 laboratory .
Mosquito -- reservoir animal -- mosquito . Humans are dead-end hosts . Equines -LRB- horses , mules , and donkeys -RRB- are amplifying hosts for the epidemic subtypes of VEEV , with high viremias that can infect a wide range of mosquitoes . Half of infected equids die from VEEV . Viremia lasts 2 -- 5 days in birds and 3 days in equids . Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days .
IgM antibody detection in CSF -LRB- in serum may not be from the current infection -RRB- , neutralization test on paired acute and convalescent sera ; RT-PCR . Virus isolation takes time . IFA in necropsy brain tissue is definitive .

Third generation cephalosporins -LRB- e.g. ceftriaxone or cefotaxime -RRB- . Other beta-lactam antibiotics may be used in case the organism is susceptible , like amoxicillin . Alternative agents are : fluoroquinolones , macrolides , and tetracyclines .
Alveolar or multilocular echinococcosis .
Personal anti-insect measures ; there is no vaccine . Removal of culicoides breeding sites in cacao husks and felled banana trunks .
Clinical diagnosis of active disease by presence of follicles and papillae on the conjunctival epithelium of the upper eyelid . Trichiasis and corneal opacity are also diagnosed clinically . Presence or absence of infecting agent -LRB- by any method , including PCR -RRB- has poor correlation with presence or absence of disease or its severity ; serology has no diagnostic value .
Mosquitoes . In North America , Culiseta melanura birdto-bird ; Aedes or Coquillettidia spp . from bird to other vertebrates -LRB- including horses and humans -RRB- . In South America , Culex spp .
Serology -LRB- IgM ELISA , Western blot , strip immunoblot , IFA -RRB- ; RT-PCR of biopsy material .
Use closed footwear ; thoroughly clean penetrating wounds in endemic areas .
Rat -- mollusc -- rat ; humans are incidental dead-end hosts . Larvae are excreted with rat feces , ingested by vectormolluscs , in which they develop into the infecting third stage larvae in about 12 days . When ingested by a rat , the larvae enter the brain , mature into adults , and migrate through the bloodstream to the lungs . There , female worms lay eggs -LRB- about 15,000 per day -RRB- that hatch into larvae , which in 6 -- 8 weeks migrate through the bronchial system up the trachea to the pharynx , are swallowed and excreted . When ingested by a human , the third stage larvae also migrate to the CNS , but the worm does not mature .
Zika virus is present in the tropical regions in the Old World and is absent from the Americas -LRB- a single case in the USA was imported from Yap island -RRB- . The competence of mosquitoes on the American continent for Zika virus is unknown . The geographic distribution is confirmed by virus isolation from cases , mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys . Positive results in serosurveys are not conclusive , because of extensive cross-reactions among flaviviruses . In 2007 a virgin soil epidemic affected 73 % of the population of Yap island . There were no hospitalizations or deaths during this outbreak . Due to intense air travel in the Pacific region and presence of competent vectors , there is concern that the disease will spread to other islands and even beyond . Adult females have higher attack rates and few cases are found above the age of 60 years . Approximately 18 % of individuals infected by the Zika virus develop symptoms ; this is similar to that reported for West Nile virus infection .

Replace water buffaloes by tractors , and livestock management like fencing off water buffaloes .
Person-to-person transmission occurs parentally -LRB- blood to blood -RRB- . Mother to child transmission or transmission via sexual contact is rare . Mother to child transmission increases if the mother is co-infected with HIV .
Humans ; the parasite has also been detected in non-human primates -LRB- cynomolgus monkeys , macaques -RRB- . E. moshkovskii can be found in varying wet environments : clean river sediments , sewage , and brackish coastal pools .
None .
Each hantavirus has its specific rodent host . HPS is generally caused by the sigmodontine-borne hantaviruses . Phylogenetic analysis reveals that hantaviruses have a long co-evolutionary history with their host .
Streptobacillosis , streptobacillary fever , Haverhill fever , epidemic arthritic erythema , spirillosis , spirillary fever , sodoku .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment . Aspirin should be avoided .
Crustaceans infected with metacercaria larvae are ingested by the reservoir host , excyst in the gut and migrate to the tissues , usually the lungs . There they encapsulate , mature , and lay eggs . Eggs enter the sputum which is coughed up and swallowed , then pass out in the feces into water and hatch in 2 -- 4 weeks into miracidia larvae . These penetrate the body of the vector snail , where they develop in about 2 months into cercaria larvae which enter and encyst in freshwater crabs and crayfish .
Infective sporozoites are inoculated by the bite of anopheles mosquitoes and through the bloodstream and lymphatics reach the liver where they differentiate into tissue schizonts that release merozoites , or to a dormant stage -LRB- hypnozoite -RRB- that can become active after months or years , causing relapse . Merozoites released from liver infect erythrocytes that develop to schizonts , rupture and release merozoites that will infect new erythrocytes -LRB- this cycle takes 48 hours -RRB- . Some merozoites develop into gametocytes that are able to infect mosquitoes during a blood meal .
By flea bite for the bubonic form , by the respiratory route for the pneumonic form ; handling carcasses or eating meat of infected animals . Person-to-person transmission occurs through the bite of fleas -LRB- bubonic form -RRB- or respiratory droplets -LRB- pneumonic form -RRB- .
No specific treatment is available .
There is an asexual phase in humans and a sexual phase in the vector mosquito . The mosquito injects sporozoites that invade human liver cells where they reproduce and develop to merozoites , which , after release , infect erythrocytes . The erythrocytic stages multiply around 10-fold every 48-hours . Erythrocytes can release gametocytes which infect mosquitoes during a blood meal . In the mosquito , gametocytes develop into sporozoites .
Typically a cardiopulmonary infection as opposed to the primarily renal infection produced by Old World hantaviruses ; renal involvement and hemorrhage are rare in NewWorld cases . Symptoms are fever , myalgia , and GI pain , followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension , with rapid progression to respiratory failure and shock . Convalescence is prolonged . CFR is 35 -- 60 % .
The fungus grows as a mycelium in the environment and in human or animal tissue it converts into a budding yeast .
Supportive ; vitamin A supplementation is important to avoid the complications of vitamin A deficiency resulting from the infection . Efficacy of ribavirin is unproven .
The detection of virus by culture or PCR in characteristic skin lesions . Histopathology and immunohistochemistry also support the diagnosis . Laboratory testing should be performed in specialized laboratories .
Unknown .
Via fecal contaminated water , drinks or food from infected individuals or carriers ; transmission may also occur in men who have sex with men .
Vaccination of livestock and humans with occupational risk in endemic areas . Antibiotic prophylaxis when exposed and vaccination in case of inhalation anthrax . Infected animal carcases should be burned or deeply buried , preferably at the site of death .
The first hantavirus found in the New World was Sin Nombre virus in the ` Four Corners ' area -LRB- USA -RRB- in 1993 , where an outbreak occurred of severe pulmonary disease in previously healthy adults . Since then , sporadic outbreaks have been detected throughout the Americas , with new strains and reservoir hosts . Approximately 200 cases of HPS per year are reported in the Americas . There is no HPS in the Caribbean , probably because the rodent host Sigmodontinae is infrequent there . The number of cases is much smaller than that of HFRS in the Old World , but the CFR is higher . Cases confirmed by serology have been reported in Colombia and Venezuela but the identity of the hantavirus unknown . Seoul virus -LRB- see Hantavirus Disease , OldWorld map -RRB- seropositives in humans and Rattus norvegicus are found in many port cities in the Americas , spread by shipping , but without evidence of disease . Risk of exposure to hantavirus is correlated with outdoor occupations such as agriculture , in which a person might encounter rodents or their excreta ; the greatest risk is entering rodent-infested closed buildings . Epidemiology differs by country and virus . In household contacts of index patients with HPS in Chile , the risk of secondary cases was 17.6 % among sex partners and 1.2 % among other household members . Infection is more common in males , with most cases occurring within the 20 -- 40 age group .
RT-PCR on whole blood or serum ; virus isolation ; plaque reduction neutralization test -LRB- there is crossreactivity with related viruses , including CHIKV -RRB- .
Direct contact with sick or dead poultry -LRB- most common -RRB- infected with HPAI , and possibly via inhalation of virus-laden particles or contact of contaminated material with the eyes or respiratory mucosa . Other postulated routes : ingestion of water contaminated with the feces of infected birds , consumption of undercooked products from infected birds . Often , however , the route of exposure is not clear . Limited person-to-person transmission of HPAI H5N1 is possible following prolonged close contact with an infected patient .
Hydrophobia , furious rabies , paralytic -LRB- dumb -RRB- rabies , classic rabies , non-classic rabies
Hard ticks , principally Ixodes scapularis -LRB- formerly I. dammini -RRB- and I. pacificus in North America , I. persulcatus and I. ricinus in Eurasia . In Russia , the principal vectors are I. persulcatus in the west and I. ricinus in the east .
Long-tailed and pigtailed macaques , and banded leaf monkeys . P. knowlesi can also infect other primates , including New World marmosets -LRB- Callithrix jacchus -RRB- , African olive baboons -LRB- Papio anubis -RRB- , Old World macaques , and humans by blood passage and mosquito bites .
The global dengue distribution follows vector presence and introduction of the virus , and occurs basically between the 10 C isotherms . Autochthonous dengue fever cases appeared in Europe for the first time in 2010 , north of 10 C isotherm and likely transmitted by Ae . albopictus -LRB- see Aedes agypti and Aedes albopictus map -RRB- . There is strong seasonality , correlated with the rainy season , which produces a marked increase in vectors because more mosquito-breeding sites become available then . Two , 3 or all 4 serotypes may occur concurrently . DHF/DSS in many countries is most often seen in children suffering a secondary infection with a different serotype . Incidence rates of up to 3 % have been seen in dengue na√µve populations such as are found in some Pacific islands .
Human infections occur via two main transmission routes : -LRB- 1 -RRB- mosquito bite , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals -LRB- e.g. slaughtering , butchering , veterinary procedures , animal births , disposing of carcasses or fetuses -RRB- by percutaneous inoculation or inhaling aerosols . Transmissionmay be possible via consumption of raw milk of an infected animal . Person-toperson transmission has not been described . However , humans develop high viral loads in the blood , and may transmit virus to contacts .
Serologic tests to assess active infection : HBsAg , HBeAg ; HBV DNA can be detected in blood by PCR ; quantitative PCR to monitor treatment .
Depends on the type of infection and severity . S. pneumoniae is an important cause of severe pneumonia , meningitis , and sepsis . It also is a common cause of otitis media and sinusitis . It can cause deep-seated infections involving any organ in a disseminated disease .
Supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation . There is no specific treatment , but ribavirin may have some effect . Monoclonal antibodies as post-exposure prophylaxis before onset of clinical signs .
Spores of Bacillus anthracis , a Gram-positive , encapsulated , non-motile rod . The spores are resistant to desiccation , extremes of temperature and pH , ultraviolet radiation and many disinfectants , and can remain viable for 60 years . It is considered a biological warfare agent .

Rift Valley fever virus -LRB- RVFV -RRB- , an enveloped , singlestranded tripartite RNA virus , belonging to the genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae . There are three lineages : Egyptian , West African , and East-Central African . Zinga virus , isolated in 1982 inMadagascar , was later found to be a strain of RVFV .
Anisakiasis , pseudaterranovosis , Cod worm disease , Herring worm disease , Whaleworm disease , and Sealworm disease .
Humans .
Intravenous , intramuscular , and intralesional application of pentavalent antimonials ; also miltefosine is being tested for its efficacy . Topical treatment options are : paramomycin , ketoconazole , and thermotherapy .
Clinical presentation depends on level of immune suppression . P. marneffei is most often an opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts -LRB- < 100 cells/m L -RRB- . Most present with fever and typical skin lesions . Other findings are anemia , generalized lymphadenopathy , weight loss , and hepatosplenomegaly . Respiratory signs can also be observed . Skin lesions are often papules with central necrosis on the face and neck , but other body sites can also have lesions . Other opportunistic infections also need to be excluded in these patients .
Mainly humans ; rarely domestic animals . Humans can be short-term carriers after an infection -LRB- 10 % -RRB- or become chronic carriers in the biliary tract -LRB- 1 -- 5 % -RRB- , shedding viable bacteria in the stool . Chronic carriers are mainly adults with pre-existingbiliary tractpathology.Urinary carriagemay occur in areas where Schistosoma haematobium is endemic .
ONNV is transmitted by the African malaria vectors Anopheles funestus and An . gambiae , and probably other members of the complex .
Eggs hatch in water and release miracidia larvae that penetrate the snail , where they develop to cercariae that encyst on aquatic plants -LRB- e.g. watercress -RRB- and become desiccation resistant metacercariae . After the plants are eaten by herbivores -LRB- e.g. sheep , cattle -RRB- , or water containing metacercariae is drunk , the larvae pass through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity , enter the liver , and lay eggs in the bile duct , which are then excreted in the feces . The whole cycle takes 3 to 4 months .
Anti-mosquito measures : light-colored clothing with long sleeves mosquito repellents containing DEET on exposed skin , avoid as much as possible outdoor activities at dawn and dusk , when mosquitoes are most active , and removal of mosquito-breeding sites from around the home .
Hard ticks -LRB- Ixodidae -RRB- . Depending on the tick species , they can acquire infection via feeding on animals with rickettsemia , or via venereal , transovarial , and trans-stadial passage . Animals preferred for feeding varies by tick species and their life stage.Rodent hosts include ground squirrels , mice , and voles .
Symptoms are similar to smallpox , but milder : fever , headache , myalgia , backache , lymphadenopathy -LRB- not seen in smallpox -RRB- , malaise , sore throat , cough , shortness of breath , followed by a vesicular-pustular rash on the face and body ; the lesions eventually crust and fall off . The outcome can be fatal -LRB- CFR : 1 -- 10 % -RRB- .
Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness world wide and is generally a disease of poor rural communities . These communities are often in hot and dry regions . It is estimated that there are about 41 million people with active trachoma and 8 million with trichiasis . Highest prevalences are found in Sub-Saharan Africa . There is a high burden in Ethiopia and Sudan , where active trachoma in some communities can be found in > 50 % of 1 -- 9-year-old children and trichiasis in > 19 % of adults . In Asia and Central and South America , the distribution ismore focal . Overall the incidence of trachoma is declining and the disease has disappeared from Europe and North America due to improved living conditions .
Serology -LRB- IgM ELISA or EIA -RRB- ; RT-PCR on blood in early phase of disease ; virus isolation in specialized laboratories .
By airborne droplets from or contact with nose and throat secretions of infected persons , very high from 4 days before to 4 days after rash appears , or with fomites contaminated with those secretions . Droplets remain infectious for several hours , longer under conditions of low humidity . Measles virus is highly contagious .
The dimorphic fungi : Histoplasma capsulatum -LRB- worldwide -RRB- and H. capsulatum var . duboisii -LRB- Africa -RRB- . The fungi grow as a mycelium in the soil at ambient temperatures and convert to the yeast form in the lung at body temperature .
Human .
Epidemic or louse-borne relapsing fever -LRB- LBRF -RRB- , endemic or tick-borne relapsing fever -LRB- TBRF -RRB- .
Ebola viruses : unknown route . Bats have not yet been implicated in the initiation of ebola outbreaks . However , most outbreaks are associated with the consumption or contact with diverse non-human primates , suggesting that transmission could occur from bats to monkeys to humans ; exposure to contaminated body fluids ; by direct person-toperson contact ; via injection with re-used syringes ; preparing bodies of cases for burial . Marburg viruses : most outbreaks are associated with index cases visiting caves or working in mines . As Egyptian fruit bats are cave animals , transmission may occur directly from bats to humans or via contact with their excreta and secreta ; transmission between humans is similar as for ebola virus . ` Cuevaviruses ' are probably apathogenic for humans .
Cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis -LRB- CL -RRB- : Aleppo evil , Baghdad boil , Delhi boil , Oriental sore , Delhi boil , and others .

Other routes are : sharing contaminated needles ; mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy , childbirth and breastfeeding ; blood or blood product transfusion ; and organ or tissue transplantation .
There is a natural cycle between ticks and animals with humans as accidental host .
Painless cutaneous lesions appear at the site of sandfly bite and typically these develop into ulcers with a raised border . Occasionally nodular and rarely verrucous lesions . Multiple lesions and regional lymphadenopathy may be present . Lesions may resolve spontaneously or remain for several months to years .

Approximately 1 million people are infected with Schistosoma spp . in Cambodia , China , Lao PDR , and the Philippines . Schistosomiasis has been eliminated from Japan and the burden has been greatly reduced in China through extensive control efforts . Schistosomiasis is a water-based disease , that mainly affects rural agricultural and fishing communities . Higher disease prevalence rates in endemic regions are found close to large irrigation projects or dams . S. japonicum is found in China , Philippines , and Indonesia . In Indonesia , schistosomiasis is confined to two endemic areas in Central Sulawesi . S. mekongi is found in the Mekong River area of Cambodia and Laos , and has also been detected in Thailand . S. malayensis has only been reported from Malaysia and is a rare cause of human disease .
Humans are the main reservoir . Subclinical infection is likely common in endemic areas , as M. leprae DNA can be found in nasal swabs in up to 5 % of healthy individuals in Asian endemic regions . Subclinical infection generally does not develop into clinical disease . Natural infection occurs in armadillos and several primates .
Repeated direct contact with infected secretions from infected individual -LRB- mainly from eye to nose -RRB- ; also by hands and fomites -LRB- shared clothes , towels , or bedlinen -RRB- . Flies also play a role in the transmission . High risk of infection in close contacts of infected individuals .
Mosquitoes -LRB- Aedes and Culex spp . -RRB- .
Domestic and free living ungulates -LRB- cattle , sheep , and goats -RRB- . Also found in other livestock , birds , pets -LRB- cats and dogs -RRB- , and ticks . Infected animals are generally asymptomatic , but infection may lead to late abortion .
Female mosquito of the genus Anopheles -LRB- see Anopheles map -RRB- .
By tick bite or blood transfusion . Most transmission to humans is by the nymphal tick stage .
Visual inspection for adult worm protruding from the skin lesion ; microscopic identification of larvae released when lesion is immersed in water .
It is estimated that more than 207 million people are infected world wide , with 85 % of them in Africa . Infection does not produce full immunity , so reinfection occurs . Schistosomiasis is a water-based disease that mainly affects rural agricultural and fishing communities . Higher disease prevalence rates in endemic regions are found close to irrigation projects or dams . Man-made water bodies like dams can lead to changes in snail habitat and cause a shift from urogenital to intestinal schistosomiasis -LRB- Egypt -RRB- and vice versa -LRB- Senegal -RRB- . S. mansoni was presumably introduced with the slave trade from west Africa into South America and the Caribbean S. intercalatum and S. guineensis are geographically restricted to Central Western Africa .
Enterotoxin-producing Vibrio cholerae 01 and 0139 Bengal . Serogroup 01 has two biotypes , classical and El Tor , each with three serotypes : Inaba , Ogawa , and the rarer Hikojima .
Anti-mosquito precautions .
Person-to-person via inhalation of infectious aerosols from cases with pulmonary TB , particularly after prolonged exposure over time . Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is generally not communicable . HIV-infected individuals are more likely to develop TB .
Majority will be asymptomatic in the acute phase , but approximately 80 % develops chronic HCV disease . Acute disease : insidious onset with right upper quadrant pain , fatigue , nausea , malaise and vomiting ; some progress to jaun-dice and dark urine . Most infected cases -LRB- approx. 80 % -RRB- develop chronic disease with fatigue as main symptom ; 20 -- 30 % even-tually develop severe liver disease : cirrhosis and liver cancer -LRB- may take 20 years and is dependent on the presence of other risk factors -RRB- . HCV infection is an important cause for liver transplantation in developed countries . There is accelerated progression of hepatic fibrosis and increased risk of hepato-cellular carcinoma in : men , elderly , obese , alcoholics , those infected with HIV or hepatitis B virus .
Clonorchiasis is the most common liver fluke in humans . Estimates show that approximately 35 million people are infected world wide , of which 15 million are in China . In endemic areas , the highest prevalence is in adults over 30 years of age . The intensity of human infection depends on the eating habits of the population . In Asia , eating raw fish is common together with alcohol consumption and , therefore , men are more often infected than women . The incidence is low in children . In China the prevalence in some regions is increasing , probably due to increased consumption of raw freshwater fish . The geographical extent of the disease is determined by snail distribution , the eating habits of the local population , and contamination of freshwater with egg-containing feces . In southern China the disease is maintained by the practice of using human feces in carp raising ponds to promote plankton growth , on which the fish feed . In non-endemic areas it appears in Asian immigrants , and in people who consume raw , dried , smoked or pickled fish imported from endemic areas .
Identification of intracellular amastigotes in stained smears from blood , bone marrow , spleen , liver , lymph nodes . PCR is sensitive and specific . Serologic tests can be useful , though they may be negative in HIV-infected patients with leishmaniasis . Rapid diagnostic tests -LRB- rK39 -RRB- are available .
Culiseta melanura : bird to bird ; Aedes or Coquillettidia spp. : from bird to other vertebrates -LRB- including horses and humans -RRB- . Viremia lasts 2 -- 5 days in birds , and the extrinsic cycle in mosquitoes lasts 2 -- 3 days . Horses and humans are dead-end hosts because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes .
By tick bite or crushing an infected tick or its feces into a break in the skin or mucous membrane . Also by blood transfusion and , in the laboratory , aerosol .
B. pseudomallei is a soil and water saprophyte and can survive for long periods in moist soil and mammalian tissues . Infection has been found in a wide range of animals , but none is thought to be a reservoir host .
Poliovirus , an RNA enterovirus with three types ; type 1 cases are most common , followed by type 3 ; wild type 2 disappeared in 1999 . Rare cases of all three types occur in unimmunized contacts of children vaccinated with the Sabin live attenuated vaccine .
SINV has been isolated from Africa , Eurasia , and Australia . The highest disease burden is in northern Europe -LRB- approximately between 60 and 64 N -RRB- and South Africa . Evolutionary studies show that SINV likely originated from South America , with subsequent spread to North America , Asia , and Australia , with later spread to Europe and Africa . Intererestingly , there are high levels of gene sequence similarities of SINV isolates within the same north -- south axis , which correlates with major bird migration patterns -LRB- see Bird Migration map -RRB- . Preferred habitat is a wetland ecosystem . The disease is seasonal , coinciding with the period of mosquito abundance and reservoir presence . Overwintering in the northern hemisphere may be by vertical transmission in the vectors . In Scandinavia , most cases occur in July through September , when there is plenty of vector species . Peak incidence in Karelia is about one month after the peak in Finland . Highest attack rates in Finland are in the eastern parts , and mainly in the age group 45 to 65 years . Epidemics tend to occur every 7 years in Finland , with the last epidemic in 2002 . No epidemic occurred in 2009 , probably due to a decline in the grouse population .
About 60 % of exposures result in asymptomatic infection . Symptoms range from benign pulmonary infection -LRB- fever , chills , cough , chest pain , dyspnea -RRB- , night sweats , anorexia and weight loss to progressive pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease involving skin , bones and/or joints , the central nervous system , and other organ systems . Most patients with primary disease recover spontaneously and have life-long immunity to re-infection . Chronic and disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to 5 % of cases . Meningeal infection occurs in less than 1 % of extrapulmonary cases and requires life-long treatment .
Food-borne botulism : intensive supportive care and polyvalent botulinum antitoxin iv . Wound botulism : wound debridement , antibiotics -LRB- penicillin -RRB- and polyvalent botulinum antitoxin iv . Equine botulinum antitoxin can prevent progression of illness and shorten symptoms in food-borne and wound botulism if administered early . Avoid aminoglycoside antibiotics as these may potentiate the toxin and result in a complete neuromuscular blockade and resultant paralysis .
By mosquito bite .
Detection of viral RNA in blood by RTPCR ; serology -LRB- IgM ELISA -RRB- ; virus culture .
The disease is limited geographically to the range of the vector tick . Hyalomma spp . do not occur in the Americas and Oceania . Historically the tick does not appear above 50 N latitude , but possibly due to changes in climate and environment the tick and CCHFV outbreaks have occurred above this latitude . In the northern hemisphere , H. marginatum becomes more active by increasing temperatures during spring -LRB- April -- May -RRB- and immature stages are active from May to September . The potential roles of migratory birds and the movement of livestock carrying ticks in the spread of the virus are unclear . CCHFV outbreaks mainly occur in those working in agricultural areas . About 90 % of the cases in a recent outbreak in Turkey were farmers . Cases regularly had skin contact with livestock or other animals . Also outdoor activities -LRB- hiking , camping -RRB- in endemic areas are a risk factor . Countries on the map marked as having no data -LRB- western Sahara , Palestine , parts of the Arabian peninsula , Kashmir -RRB- are within the range of the vector tick and likely at risk for CCHFV outbreaks . CCHFV genotypes cluster geographically , with exceptions : the Asia 1 genotype has been found in Madagascar , where it was possibly introduced by migrating birds , and Africa 1 in the Middle East , which may have been introduced with infected livestock .
Loiasis is not as severe as other filarial diseases . Typical finding is transient subcutaneous swellings -LRB- Calabar swellings -RRB- which are angiedemas . These swellings are itchy and mainly occur on the limbs , especially forearms and when close to joints may restrict movement . Less frequently : giant urticaria , arthritis , and fever . The adult worm sometimes migrates across the subconjunctiva of the eye . Encephalopathic reactions may occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns to control onchocerciasis . These SAEs mainly occur in those with heavy infection -LRB- > 30,000 microfilariae per ml blood -RRB- .

Vaccination with vaccines based on capsular polysaccharides . Both conjugated and non-jugated vaccines are available . Conjugated vaccines targeting either 7 , 9 , 10 , or 13 capsule types are recommended for children under 5 years of age and risk groups . The 23-valent non-conjugated vaccine can only be used in individuals older than 2 years and at high risk of disease . National surveillance of pneumococcal disease and infecting serotypes is required to detect vaccine escapees , requiring vaccine modification . Individuals are not protected against pneumococcal capsule types not in the vaccine . Through the GAVI Alliance , low-income countries can access pneumococcal vaccines with a small contribution . Rwanda was the first GAVI-eligible country that introduced the vaccine in 2009 .
LPAI viruses naturally circulate in wild birds , principally waterfowl and gulls , in which they generally cause no symptoms . LPAI viruses are transmitted to terrestrial poultry -LRB- chickens , turkeys -RRB- . LPAI most likely evolved to HPAI in aquatic birds -LRB- ducks and geese -RRB- . Transmission of HPAI into migratory birds can result in large die-offs .

VEEV is considered a potential biological warfare agent .
Freshwater snails -LRB- Bithynia spp . -RRB- .
Individuals with trichiasis require eyelid surgery . Active disease requires antibiotics : azithromycin or tetracycline eye ointment are recommended . Treatment of individual cases has little impact , because of rapid reinfection . Community management using the SAFE strategy -LRB- Surgery for trichiasis , Antibiotics to clear infection , Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement -LSB- water and sanitation -RSB- to reduce transmission -RRB- is the recommended means for control in endemic areas ; this strategy includes both treatment and prevention .

SARS coronavirus -LRB- SARS-CoV -RRB- is a positive-sense , single-stranded , enveloped RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae . The viral membrane contains a transmembrane -LRB- M -RRB- glycoprotein , spike -LRB- S -RRB- glycoprotein , and envelope -LRB- E -RRB- protein . Coronaviruses derive their name from the crown-like -LRB- coronalike -RRB- morphology on electron microscopy .
Mycobacterium ulcerans , an acid-fast , slow-growing bacillus . There are at least four geographically distinct strains : African , American , Asian , and Australian . They all produce mycolactone , which destroys tissue and suppresses the immune system . Variations in the structure of mycolactone may correlate with disease severity in different regions .
VEEV was isolated for the first time in 1938 from a diseased horse in Venezuela . The VEEV distribution is limited to the Americas , and predominantly in Central and South America . In 1995 , a large outbreak with approximately 100,000 human cases , of which 300 were fatal , happened in Colombia and Venezuela . The Guajira peninsula -LRB- region in northern Colombia and northwest Venezuela -RRB- has the highest disease burden , probably due to a large donkey population that serves as an amplifying host . In 2005 , human VEE cases were detected for the first time in Bolivia , cause by a new Bolivia -- Peru ID genotype . Typical VEEV enzootic habitats are lowland forests and swamps in -LRB- sub -RRB- tropical areas of the Americas , from northern Argentina up to southern USA -LRB- Florida and Colorado -RRB- . Enzootic subtype distribution generally does not overlap , except in the Amazon regions .

Gram stain and culture of CSF , blood , or synovial fluid . Capsular polysaccharide antigen detection by latex agglutination or other techniques . PCR from normally sterile site .
Blood culture with prolonged incubation -LRB- 42 days -RRB- ; lysis centrifugation blood culture systems or subculture of blood culture bottles onto fresh chocolate agar enhances sensitivity . Several serological assays are available -LRB- CFT , ELISA , IFA -RRB- , but cross-reactivity occurs ; PCR on blood and tissue .
Human-deer-fly-human . After infectivelarvae enter the wound they migrate and develop into adult worms in subcutaneous tissue . Adult worms produce microfilariae , that circulate in the peripheral blood in daytime and can be taken up by the next fly during feeding . In the fly they develop into larvae in 10 -- 12 days and enter the proboscis , and the cycle repeats . An infected human can remain infectious to the vector for up to 15 years . Transmission is facilitated by the fact that microfilaremia and the vector-biting activity occur in daytime .
Group A rotaviruses have been established as the single most important cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in young children in developed and developing nations . Rotavirus is estimated to cause 138 million diarrheal episodes per year with 2 million requiring hospitalization and 440,000 deaths in children of < 5 years . The incidence of rotavirus disease is similar in developed and developing countries , but deaths mainly occur in poverty stricken nations due to poor health infrastructure . Control is likely not achieved by improvements in clean water access , hygiene , and sanitation . Rotavirus vaccines are recommended to prevent severe and fatal rotavirus disease . For vaccine introduction , knowledge of the regional circulating rotavirus serotypes is needed . The epidemiology of rotavirus serotypes has substantial temporal and geographic variability and multiple serotypes may cocirculate within the same region and fluctuates each year within the same region . The 5 most common rotavirus serotypes -LRB- G1 -- G4 and G9 -RRB- were responsible for approximately 95 % of infections world wide with G1 -LSB- P8 -RSB- responsible for more than 70 % of infections in North America , Australia , and Europe but only 30 % of infections in South America , Asia , and Africa .
Direct : acid fast smear/culture and PCR of sputum and other body fluids , depending on clinical presentation ; serological : tuberculin skin test -LRB- Mantoux -RRB- ; interferon gamma release assays -LRB- IGRAs -RRB- .

Not completely understood ; most Bunyamwera viruses are likely maintained in nature involving a transmission cycle with various small mammals -LRB- mainly wild rodents -RRB- as amplifying hosts and mosquitoes . African rodents replicate BUNV and develop viremia . Livestock -LRB- goats , sheep , cattle -RRB- , horses and rodents are hosts for GERV as shown by seroprevalence studies . Amplifying hosts for CVV are mainly large mammals -LRB- caribou , deer , horses , sheep -RRB- .
Large marsupials , particularly kangaroos and wallabies .
Mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito . There is an enzootic cycle , mainly between C. taralsis and passerine birds . There is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits . Viremia lasts 2 -- 5 days in birds . Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days . Humans and horses are dead-end hosts for WEEV because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes .
Headache , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and hepatomegaly . In the later stage of the disease , the metacestode may grow into neighboring organs -LRB- e.g. through the diaphragm into the lungs -RRB- , and metastases can form anywhere . The differential diagnosis is hepatic cirrhosis or carcinoma . The disease can be fatal .
Paracoccidioidomycosis is a chronic progressive systemic mycosis . There are two disease forms : -LRB- 1 -RRB- an acute/subacute form in children that mainly involves the reticulo-endothelial system , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- a chronic or adult form with a long latent period , that mainly affects men and generally is a pulmonary infection . The disease can disseminate to mucous membranes , skin , and lymph nodes . Relapses occur in immune-compromised patients and in those with disseminated disease . CFR can be up to 10 % , highest in children with underlying conditions , and lowest in adults .
Klebsiella granulomatis , formerly Calymmatobacterium granulomatis , a Gram-negative facultative aerobic coccobacillus .
Fluorquinolones are recommended in the absence of resistance . Resistance to ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and cotrimoxazole is widespread and resistance to older generation quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins is rising . Both gatifloxacin and azithromycin can be recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated cases in areas with MDR or nalidixic acid resistance . Third-generation cephalosporins is used for severe cases . Surgery for abdominal complications -LRB- e.g. perforation -RRB- . Dexamethason is recommended for severe cases .

The distribution of RMSF and R. parkeri rickettsiosis is limited by the tick vector distribution . Average annual RMSF incidence of the disease in the USA was 2.2 cases per million between 1997 and 2002 , and approximately 250 -- 1,200 cases are reported each year . Many cases of RMSF may actually have been caused by other rickettsial agents , as was seen with R. parkeri . Many rickettsiae of unknown pathogenicity are present in ticks and new disease causing agents are still being discovered . RMSF in the USA follows a seasonal pattern with most cases in warmer months , when ticks are most active . RMSF cases are usually found in rural areas , and less commonly in urban areas . Residing in wooded regions or areas with high grass and exposure to dogs increases the risk of RMSF . RMSF is sporadic and rarely occurs in clusters .

Respiratory diphtheria is classically associated with fever , inflammation of the pharynx or larynx , pseudomembrane formation , lymphadenopathy and edema of the soft tissues of the neck . However , most cases are mild and may resemble streptococcal pharyngitis and the pseudomembrane may be absent . The exotoxin of C. diphtheriae can cause polyneuritis and myocarditis . Nasal diphtheria is usually mild and chronic with nasal discharge and ulceration . Cutaneous diphtheria is characterized by chronic , sharply demarcated ulcers with an adherent gray pseudomembrane . It is usually associated with skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and group A streptococci .

Extrapulmonary TB is more common in children < 5 years . Early symptoms of pulmonary TB are weight loss , fever , and night sweats , progressing to cough , chest pain , and hemoptysis . Findings of extrapulmonary TB depends on infected organ -LRB- s -RRB- , and may present together with pulmonary TB .
Taeniosis is T. solium infection of the small intestine and varies from asymptomatic -LRB- the most frequent -RRB- to weight loss , anorexia and abdominal pain . Cysticercosis is a tissue infection with T. solium larvae with findings depending on where cysticerci develop -LRB- subcutaneous , eye , heart , CNS -RRB- . Its localization in the CNS , causing neurocysticercosis , is the most severe form of the disease : seizures , headache , focal neurologic signs , epilepsy , and hydrocephalus may develop . The CFR is low .

Symptomatic cases : fever , chills , myalgia , fatigue , and jaundice , hemolytic anemia ; severe cases : retinal infarctions , ecchymoses and petechiae , acute respiratory failure , congestive heart failure , DIC , liver and renal failure , and splenic rupture , with a mortality rate of 5 -- 9 % , higher in immunocompromised patients . The differential diagnosis is chloroquine-resistant malaria , Lyme disease , or human granulocytic anaplasmosis .
In early and limited disease : 4 weeks of streptomycin and rifampicin followed by 4 weeks of rifampicin and clarithromycin . For more extensive disease : rifampicin plus streptomycin for 8 weeks ; extensive lesions may require reconstructive surgery and physiotherapy . Lesions < 5cm can be excised under local anesthetic .
World wide there are approximately 1.5 million new cases of CL per year , with most cases reported from Afghanistan , Algeria , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , and Syria in the Old World . The highest burden of CL in the Old Word is in rural semi-arid and desert regions , but transmission is being increasingly seen in peri-urban and urban environments . Disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus , likely due to acquired immunity . Clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households , which is likely related to the short flight range of sandflies .
Influenza A subtype H5N1 , a RNA virus , family Orthomyxoviridae . Avian influenza H5N1 occurs in two forms , a virulent form known as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 -LRB- HPAI H5N1 -RRB- and a milder form known as ` low pathogenic ' -LRB- LPAI H5N1 -RRB- .

Hard ticks , principally Hyalomma spp. , also Boophilus spp . and Rhipicephalus spp .
Mosquitoes . In North America , the primary vector of WEEV for the enzootic cycle is Culex tarsalis . WEEV is transmitted to humans and horses by bridging mosquitoes -LRB- e.g. Ochlerotatus melanimon and Aedes species -RRB- .
Ticks introduce Babesia spp . sporozoites from the ticks ' salivary glands into small mammals/humans during feeding . The sporozoites infect erythrocytes in which they asexually reproduce by budding and develop through various stages into gametocytes . Ticks can take up circulating gametocytes during feeding on an infected animal . The gametocytes fertilize in the tick gut and develop into sporozoites in their salivary glands .
The only real reservoir is the tick . Viremia persists only for a few days in transmission competent vertebrates , rodents -LRB- mainly Apodemus spp . -RRB- . Deer , birds , possibly marmots are not competent to transmit to ticks .

Some patients are misdiagnosed as meningitis .
Noma is an opportunistic infection that evolves rapidly from a gingival inflammation to severe , mutilating orofacial gangrene , which is painless and usually unilateral . It begins as a small vesicle or ulcer on the gingiva that rapidly becomes necrotic and spreads to produce extensive destruction of the buccal and labial mucosa and tissues of the face , including the bone , which may result in severe disfigurement and even death . Noma can also cause tissue damage to the genitals -LRB- noma pudenda -RRB- .
Mosquitoes of the genera Aedes , Culex , Mansonia and others . There is transovarian transmission of RVFV in mosquitoes . Dried mosquito eggs can remain viable and infected for years . Originally , the eggs are laid in the damp soil above the water line and hatch when flooded .

Orientia tsutsugamushi , obligate intracellular bacterium , before 1995 known as Rickettsia tsutsugamushi . In 2010 , a new species that can cause scrub typhus was discovered in Dubai , O. chuto .
It is estimated that over one million cases of scrub typhus occur each year . Infections most often occur in rural areas where diagnostic facilities are limited . Scrub typhus is thought to occur within the so-called ` Scrub typhus triangle , ' bounded by Siberia -LRB- north -RRB- , Kamchatka Peninsula -LRB- east -RRB- , Pakistan -LRB- west -RRB- , and Australia -LRB- south -RRB- . O. tsutsugamushi infection primarily occurs in tropical climate in Asia , but is also found in temperate zones and semi-arid climates , including in scrub , gardens , forests , beach areas , and mountain deserts . In 2010 the western limit of the Orientia genus extended westwards to Dubai when a patient was diagnosed with a new Orientia species -LRB- O. chuto -RRB- . In southern China , human infections typically occur in the summer and in northern areas the disease occurs mainly during autumn and winter . The migration of infested or infected rodents can lead to the establishment of new foci of disease .
Avoid areas with mites ; mite bite prevention by impregnating clothes with miticides ; mite elimination in highrisk areas ; no effective vaccine is available .
Main transmission is fecal -- oral , but houseflies act as supplementary vectors by contaminating food after feeding on exposed human feces .

Most South and several Central American countries between 23 N and 34 S have paracoccidioidomycosis endemic regions , particularly Brazil , Colombia , Venezuela , and Argentina . The prevalence of paracoccidioidomycosis in endemic areas can be up to 75 % in adults , with active disease developing in approximately 2 % of infected individuals . The endemic areas are generally forest areas with many water streams , mild temperatures , a short winter , and a summer with moderate rain . The disease mainly affects active rural workers -LRB- coffee , cotton , and tobacco farmers -RRB- , probably due to environmental exposure . This explains why the disease is more common in men aged 30 to 60 years . Postpubertal women are partially protected by estrogen that prevents the fungus from transitioning to the yeast form . Contact with nine-banded armadillos has also been shown to be a risk factor for paracoccidioidomycosis .
Sanitation -LRB- particularly use of latrine and maintaining pigs enclosed -RRB- ; hygiene ; meat inspection ; thorough cooking of pig meat before consumption ; treatment of tapeworm carriers . A vaccine has been developed for cattle .
Wildlife -- tick -- wildlife . The tick ingests infected blood of reservoir host , virus passes from gut to hemocoele to salivary glands and is transmitted to a new host at the next feed . The virus is transmitted from tick to tick trans-stadially and transovarially . Trans-stadial transmission is key to tickborne infections .
The principle vector is the human body louse -LRB- Pediculus humanus corporis -RRB- , which lives in clothes . B. quintana has also been detected in cat and monkey fleas .
Direct person-to-person transmission , usually following close contact with a symptomatic case or the respiratory secretions or body fluids of a symptomatic case . Healthcare facilities were key in amplifying the transmission of SARS in 2003 . Respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces are thought to be the principal routes of transmission , although one outbreak in a residential block in Hong Kong was attributed to aerosol spread .
HME , HGA : fever , headache , anorexia , myalgia , nausea , and vomiting ; occasionally a rash . Leucopenia and thrombopenia are common and thrombopenia may be life-threatening . HME cases may progress to meningoencephalitis . Sennetsu fever : sudden onset fever , chills , malaise , headache , muscle and joint pain , sore throat ; generalized lymphadenopathy . Reinfection can occur . CFR is 2.7 % for HME , < 1 % for HGA , and absent for E. ewingii infection .
Since the virus has a jungle cycle , environmental insecticide spraying is not feasible ; routine personal anti-mosquito measures are indicated .

The most common clinical presentation for streptobacillosis is a triad of -LRB- 1 -RRB- relapsing fever , -LRB- 2 -RRB- severe , migratory polyarthralgias , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a peripheral , hemorrhagic maculopapular rash . The most prominent symptom is severe myalgia with prostration . Polyarthralgias occur in two-thirds of reported cases . In spirillosis , the bite site becomes indurated and may ulcerate with regional lymphadenopathy ; arthritic symptoms are rare . If untreated , the disease may progress to bacterial endocarditis , pericarditis , parotitis , tenosynovitis , and focal abscesses of soft tissues or the brain . CFR in untreated cases may be as much as 13 % . There is a significant risk of streptobacillary endocarditis with associated CFR of 50 % .
Dengue-like fever with headache , malaise , arthralgia or myalgia for about 2 to 5 days ; occasionally nausea and vomiting , lower limb weakness , conjunctivitis , photophobia and a rash . The fever resolves in a few days ; the disease is non-fatal .
Humans are the definitive host ; pigs are an intermediate host .
Lice become infective 4 -- 5 days after an infectious blood meal and remain so for life -LRB- 20 -- 30 days -RRB- . Infected ticks remain infective for life -LRB- in excess of 10 years -RRB- .
Two interacting cycles can be distinguished : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a persistent cycle in the aquatic reservoir , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- in the human host , leading to amplification through fecal -- oral spread .
ONNV is a mutant of CHIKV that appeared in 1959 in Uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of Africa , leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic . This large epidemic was remarkable because , in spite of the occurrence of millions of cases , no deaths were reported . It ended without a trace in 1962 , reappearing as sporadic cases in Africa at rare intervals . In Nigeria in 1966 and 1969 , cases were described as a new virus , IgboOra , later recognized as ONNV . There was a small outbreak in C√¥te d'Ivoire in 1984 -- 1985 and again in 2003 , also described as Igbo-Ora virus and a small recurrence in Uganda in 1996 . Serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in Kenya in 1994 -- 1995 and in horses in Nigeria , but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with CHIKV antibody . It is not known how or where the virus survives between outbreaks , but sequence data show very little variation between ONNV strains isolated in Uganda in 1959 and 1996 -- 1997 , suggesting that the virus persists , rather than undergoing repeated mutations from CHIKV -LRB- which has a non-human primate reservoir -RRB- .

Smallpox vaccine is protective , but not a feasible solution in the remote forest habitat where monkeypox is endemic . Hospital personnel should isolate patients and take infection control precautions .
Katayama syndrome is an acute form of schistosomiasis , caused by the host immune response to developing larvae and early egg production and presents with nocturnal fever , cough , myalgia , headache , and abdominal pain . Katayama syndrome is more common among infected nonimmune individuals -LRB- e.g. travelers -RRB- and relatively rare among local residents with exposure since childhood . S. mansoni causes intestinal schistosomiasis with : diarrhea , abdominal pain , blood in the stool , hepatosplenomegaly . S. haematobium causes urogenital schistosomiasis with dysuria , hematuria , hemospermia , and dyspareunia . S. intercalatumand S. guineensis : granulomas , rectal polyps and ulcers .

The disease is distributed worldwide , with the majority cases attributed to contaminated processed foods . Listeriosis is , after salmonellosis , the second most frequent cause of food-borne infection-related deaths in Europe . The disease incidence has decreased in the USA , while it increased in Europe for unknown reasons . The more regular use of immunosuppressive medications and the increasing size of the elderly population has increased the population at risk in both Europe and the USA . The majority of invasive listerial infections occurs in individuals with predisposing conditions : pregnancy , corticosteroid use , or other immunosuppressive conditions . One-third of reported cases occur in pregnant women . In non-pregnant patients corticosteroid use is the most important predisposing factor . Clinical data from Asia , Africa , and South America are lacking . L.monocytogenes has been found in food products from these regions . Food-borne outbreaks , many of which are manifested by febrile gastroenteritis , have been described with a variety of foods . The most common are processed/delicatessen meats , hot dogs , soft cheeses , smoked seafood , meat spreads , and pates . Infections from animal contact are uncommon and generally occur in veterinarians , abattoir workers , and farmers .
Tabanid and Stomoxys flies and mosquitoes can transmit , but are not epizootic vectors . Blow-flies can also spread the bacteria .

The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi . Initially identified as a single species , B. burgdorferi has been separatedinto at least 12 species . Almost all cases of Lyme disease are caused by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto , B. garinii , and B. afzelii , and very few by B. spielmanii and B. lusitaniae .
Intestinal capillariasis is generally found in countries where raw freshwater fish is eaten . The parasite was first reported in 1963 in the northern Philippines . C. philippinensisis endemic in the Philippines , Laos , and Thailand . Rare cases have been reported from other Asian countries and the Middle East . A single case has been reported in Spain imported from Colombia , but there are no other reports of cases in the Americas . Rare cases of human infection with C. hepatica and C. aerophila have been reportedworldwide . Infected fishmay be exported from endemic areas to non-endemic countries .
The virus can be transmitted from mother to child through breast-milk ; also through sexual contact , contaminated blood products , organ transplants , and shared syringes during iv drug use .
Treat patients to reduce the T. b. gambiense reservoir , and cattle to reduce the T. b. rhodesiense reservoir ; screen blood donations ; vector control : fly traps , insecticide-treated screens , ground and aerial spraying , release of sterile male tsetse flies .
S. stercoralis has a free-living -LRB- asexual -RRB- and parasitic -LRB- sexual -RRB- lifecycle . Free-living filariform -LRB- L3 -RRB- larvae in the soil penetrate the skin , enter the bloodstream , reach the lungs , travel up to the throat , and are swallowed . In the duododenal wall they mature into adult female worms , produce eggs that hatch immediately , thus only larvae -LRB- L1 -RRB- are excreted . These non-infectious -LRB- L1 -RRB- larvae develop further in the soil into either adult worms or infectious -LRB- L3 -RRB- larvae . Some non-infectious L1 larvae may develop faster into infectious L3 larvae in the human intestine and penetrate the perianal skin or colon wall . This process of auto-infection may lead to hyperinfection in immunocompromised individuals .
Less than 1 % of infections result in acute flaccid paralysis , with around 90 % of infections being subclinical . In 10 % symptoms may include fever , malaise , headache , neck stiffness , pain in the limbs , nausea , and vomiting . Paralysis persists in 0.1 -- 1.0 % depending on the virulence of the strain . The flaccid paralysis is usually asymmetric and in one leg . The risk of paralysis is increased by intramuscular injections , immune-compromised state , trauma or surgery -LRB- tonsillectomy -RRB- , and intense physical activity during the incubation period . Also adults are at greater risk of developing paralysis than young children . Aseptic meningitis occurs in around 1 % of infections . More severe paralysis with quadriplegia and breathing problems -LRB- bulbar polio -RRB- may occur .
N. meningitidis is transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets .
Immunocompromised , asplenic , and elderly people are at higher risk of symptomatic disease . The number of cases diagnosed in the USA has increased markedly since 1975 due to an increase in the white-tailed deer population , hosts of the adult vector ticks . Nearly all patients with Babesia divergens infection in Europe had been splenectomized and exposed to cattle . The B. divergens-like parasite in the USA has a reservoir in cottontail rabbits , and is not infectious for cattle ; it has been found in only 3 patients . All 3 patients with B. venatorum -LRB- EU1 -RRB- infection had also been splenectomized . Cape Verdean , Egyptian , and Asian cases lie outside the range of Ixodes ricinus ; B. duncani and B. divergens-like cases in west coast states of USA lie outside the range of I. scapularis . Possible vectors for these cases are I. dentatus in the central USA , and I. pacificus on the west coast . Infection is seasonal -LRB- summer -RRB- , coinciding with abundance of nymphal ticks in warmer months .
Pestis , pest , bubonic plague , pneumonic plague , black plague , black death .
Rarely reported in the Americas and Europe , sporadic in parts of Southeast Asia , especially Thailand , China , and Vietnam . Most important risk factor is contact with pigs or uncooked pig products , typically by farmers , veterinary personnel , abattoir workers , and butchers . Furthermore , in several Asian countries it is common to consume uncooked pork products , like blood , which is a risk for acquiring the disease . Individuals who are immunosuppressed , including those who have been splenectomized , are also at increased risk . Since S. suis is often misidentified , S. suis may be more common in certain parts of the world with high pig densities .
By inhalation of aerosolized excreta of the rodent host , or contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta . Nosocomial transmission is regular in resource-constrained settings .
None
Livestock -LRB- cattle , camels , goats , sheep -RRB- , wild buffalo , waterbuck , some rodents .
The California group viruses are widely distributed over all types of terrain . Each has its preferred vector mosquito species and host , for instance snowshoe hare for SSHV . LACV is the primary cause of arboviral encephalitis in children in the USA . Most LACV infections occur in those residing close to woodland breeding sites of Ae . triseriatusfrom July to September . Boys are more often affected with LACV , as they more often play in the woods . JCV is most commonly found around the Great Lakes in USA and Canada . The JCV vectors prefer hilly woodlands where they breed in ponds from April to June . SSHV , has a different ecosystem : -LRB- sub -RRB- arctic forests and tundras in Canada and Siberia . SSHV has been detected in China . SSHV transmission occurs during the arctic summer from May to August , and mainly affects children -LRB- < 10 years -RRB- , especially boys . Lumbo virus is a strain of TAHV isolated from mosquitoes in Mozambique -LRB- Africa -RRB- , but no human cases have been diagnosed there .

The disease mainly affects the skin , peripheral nerves , mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes , shown by patches of pigmented or reddish skin with loss of sensation , peripheral nerve enlargement with loss of sensation , sometimes paralysis , muscle wasting and trophic ulcers . Patients are classified as having either PL or ML . PL is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions . ML is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions . Skin lesions are often symmetric . Involvement of the nasal mucosa results in nasal congestion and epistaxis . Reduced sensation of digits may lead to their loss due to trauma . Up to 10 % of cases with early lesions may resolve spontaneously .
By mosquito bite . Transmission from mother to neonate can occur in the intrapartum period ; blood-borne transmission is possible .
VL is found in 62 countries where an estimated 500,000 cases occur annually and 120 million persons are at risk . Approximately 90 % of VL cases occur in rural and suburban areas of five countries : Bangladesh , India , Nepal , Sudan , and Brazil . During epidemics , > 5 % of a population may develop symptomatic infection . Persons who are under age of 5 years , malnourished and immunocompromised -LRB- including HIV-infected individuals -RRB- are more likely to develop symptomatic , often severe , infection . There are indications that VL is spreading to historically nonendemic areas , like northern parts of Europe and Western Upper Nile Sudan . Clearly the distribution of VL is dynamic and adapts to changes in demographics , human behavior , environment -LRB- deforestation , urbanization -RRB- , and host factors -LRB- HIV -RRB- . VL is reported in Chad , DRC , and Zambia , but the infectious agent is unknown.L . donovanishas been foundin Sri Lanka , but only as a cause of cutaneous leishmaniasis.x

Leptospira chronically colonize the proximal renal tubules of many animals and are excreted in the urine into the environment . Animals can shed Leptospira into the environment for prolonged periods without any signs of disease .
Eggs excreted by the mammalian host in the feces into freshwater are ingested by the snail vector . They hatch and in 2 months pass through various stages in the snail to produce motile cercariae , which leave the snail and penetrate freshwater fish . In 6 weeks the cercariae encyst , and when the fish is eaten by another mammalian host , they exit the cyst and penetrate the bile duct , where in a month they mature into adult worms and start to produce eggs .
Not completely understood : moist environments close to waterways , in forest or under flooring , also sandy and acidic soil and rotten vegetation . Bird excreta have also been implicated as a potential reservoir . Dogs are more commonly infected than humans but do not transmit disease .
Bite of infective female sandfly . Rare reports exist of non-vector transmission , including transmission by blood transfusion , sharing of syringes , venereal contact , and possibly transplacentally ; potential transmission via organ transplantation .
Fish-eating mammals -LRB- including humans -RRB- shed C. sinensis eggs into the environment that are ingested by snails , where they develop into cercariae . The motile cercariae are released into water and infect freshwater fish and encyst in meat and skin as metacercariae . When ingested by mammals , the metacercariae migrate into the bile ducts where they develop into adult flukes that produce and excrete eggs into feces . The cycle takes approximately 3 months .
Strongyloides stercoralis , a minute nematode roundworm -LRB- up to2 .2 mmlong -RRB- . S.fuelleborni -LRB- not shown on the map -RRB- is a less common agent and can causehuman diseasein Africa and Papua New Guinea -LRB- ` swollen belly syndrome ' in infants -RRB- .
Mild disease : oral itraconazole or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole . For severe cases : iv amphotericin B or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole . Treatment is long and is monitored by clinical and radiological signs .
Probably bird -- mosquito -- bird . Mosquitoes become infected when feeding on viremic reservoir birds . This is followed by an extrinsic cycle of a few days in the mosquito , with subsequent transmission to birds or humans by bite . Humans are a dead-end host . There is evidence for vertical -LRB- transovarial -RRB- transmission in mosquitoes .
Snail -- human -- snail . Infected humans shed eggs into the water , which hatch into larvae -LRB- miracidia -RRB- that enter snails and develop into motile larvae -LRB- cercariae -RRB- . The cercariae are shed into the water and penetrate the skin of humans in the water , enter the bloodstream and settle in the liver . When matured to adult male and female worms , they migrate to the abdominal veins -LRB- S. mansoni , S. intercalatum , S. guineensis -RRB- or pelvic veins -LRB- S. haematobium -RRB- , mate and produce eggs . Snails remain infectious for up to 3 months , humans for more than 10 years .
By tick bite ; larval ticks are carried on migrating birds , which are refractory to the virus . The virus is also spread among veterinarians , farmers , shepherds , butchers , and slaughter-house workers by contact with the blood of infected livestock . Person-to-person spread is by contact with infectious body fluids of patients .
Supportive for acute hepatitis B. Interferon-alpha and reverse transcriptase inhibitors for chronic hepatitis B. Treatment response , particularly interferon treatment , differs by HBV genotype . Treatment is expensive and often not available in developing countries . In Southeast Asia , medicinal herbs are widely used to treat chronic HBV disease , of which the efficacy is yet unclear . Liver transplant is possible for decompensated cirrhosis .
Humans .
F. tularensis tularensis Type A is found in North America and the distribution is associatedwith wild rabbits , ticks , and tabanid flies . Type B is found throughout the northern hemisphere , mainly in Eurasia and is associated with multiple rodent species , hares , ticks , blood-feeding mosquitoes , and tabanid flies . There is also an association with water bodies -LRB- streams -RRB- and flooding . In the USA , around 200 human tularemia cases are reported each year , mostly in rural areas during summer months . In Europe , most cases are reported from Sweden , Finland , and Russia , and is recently emerging in Spain . Rural populations are most at risk -LRB- e.g. farmers , hunters -RRB- . Human outbreaks often coincide with wild animal outbreaks .
Prevention is focused on eliminating BSE in cattle , preventing infected bovinematerial entering the animal and human food chain , and reducing the risk of secondary transmission to humans in the healthcare setting . To this end many countries have banned bovine meat and bone meal from livestock feed , slaughtered infected herds , and taken other precautions to prevent infected cattle from entering the human food chain . Measures to reduce the risk of transmission of vCJD through blood products include low-risk sourcing and leucodepletion . Further precautionary methods to reduce the risk of transmission through contaminated surgical instruments .
HFRS is caused by Myodes - , Rattus - , and Apodemusborne hantaviruses . Each virus has its particular host : Apodemus spp . -LRB- striped field mouse -RRB- for HTNV , DOBV and SAAV and Myodes -LRB- Clethrionomys -RRB- for PUUV . SEOV infects Rattus norvegicus and can therefore be found world wide .
Generally enzootic cycles of F. tularensis are unnoticed , humans are accidental hosts .
Use of safe water by filtering or boiling or disinfection with temephos -LRB- insecticide -RRB- . Avoid wading in contaminated water , especially people with an apparent worm . There is no vaccine , but tetanus toxoid may be given to prevent tetanus . The Global Guinea Worm Eradication Programme is led by the Carter Center , CDC , WHO , UN Children 's Fund and the individual efforts of endemic nations .
Colorado Tick Fever Virus -LRB- CTFV -RRB- , a prototype virus of the genus Coltivirus of the family Reoviridae ; a spherical , enveloped virus with a double-stranded RNA genome of 12 segments .
Congo fever , Congo -- Crimean hemorrhagic fever , Central Asian hemorrhagic fever
Summer diarrhea , acute diarrhea .
Serology is mainly used -LRB- immunodiffusion and CF tests -RRB- . Detection of antigen in blood , CSF , urine or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by radioimmunoassay . Microscopy on Giemsa stained bone-marrow or blood smear . Histoplasma skin tests indicate whether a person has been exposed . PCR-based tests are available . Fungal culture is generally slow .
Hendra virus disease , Nipah virus disease .
TBRF is primarily transmitted by Ornithodoros ticks . LBRF is transmitted by the human body louse -LRB- Pediculus humanus -RRB- ; neither the head louse nor the pubic louse has been shown to transmit the disease .
Praziquantel and niclosamide are the drugs of choice . In untreated cases the worms can live up to 25 years and produce eggs .
Hendra virus : encephalitis and pneumonia , with a rapid progression to death -LRB- few survive -RRB- . One case recovered from encephalitis but relapsed 14 months later and died with neurologic signs , suggesting latency and recrudescence . Nipah virus : encephalitis and pneumonia . There has been a case of relapse encephalitis more than 4 years after infection . The CFR can vary from 10 to 75 % , but is generally high .
The limits of P. falciparum malaria is determined by the presence of vector species and control measures within a certain region . P. falciparum malaria causes approximately 500 million cases each year and around one million deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa . In 2007 almost 60 % of the 2.4 billion people at risk of malaria were living in areas with a stable risk of P. falciparum . High endemicity was most common and widespread in the African region . In the Americas , those at risk were all in the low endemicity class . In Asia 88 % are in the low endemicity class , 11 % in the intermediate class , and 1 % in the high endemicity class . Recent progress is being made by the Global Malaria Action Plan to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality world wide and have a vision for malaria elimination . Ranking countries on the possibility of elimination shows that it is most feasible in the Americas and several countries in Asia and the west Pacific . It is least feasible in Africa , where much of west and central Africa need more than 90 % reduction in transmission .
Hendra virus : manage contact between fruit bats and horse by basic husbandry measures such as placing food and water points under cover , regulate movement of horses from areas where the disease is occurring , regulate import of horses from Australia during outbreaks . Nipah virus : avoid contact with fruit bats and their discharges ; wash and peel fruit , and wash hands before and after preparing fruit ; regulate importation of pigs from outbreak areas .
Pigs or humans ingest eggs from contaminated environment . Adult tapeworms will only develop in humans after eating raw or undercooked pork containing cysticerci . It takes 2 months for larvae to become an adult worm and produce eggs -LRB- up to 300,000 eggs per day -RRB- . In pigs , eggs invade the general circulation via the intestinal wall and migrate to skeletal and heart muscles where they form cysticerci .
Katayama syndrome is an acute form of schistosomiasis , caused by the host immune response to developing larvae and early egg production and presents with nocturnal fever , cough , myalgia , headache , and abdominal pain . Katayama syndrome is more common among infected nonimmune individuals -LRB- e.g. travelers -RRB- and relatively rare among local residentswith exposure since childhood . S. japonicum causes intestinal schistosomiasis with : diarrhea , abdominal pain , blood in the stool , hepatosplenomegaly . Chronic infection leads to liver fibrosis and portal hypertension , anemia , and altered growth and cognitive development in infected children ; seizures due to egg granulomas in brain or spinal cord . Infection does not produce full immunity , so reinfection occurs . S.mekongi causes similar , but milder , disease compared to S. japonicum .
