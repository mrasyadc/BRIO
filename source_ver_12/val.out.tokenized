Hib is a common invasive bacterial infection that primarily causes pneumonia , meningitis , and bacteremia . Hib meningitis may present acutely or subacutely with fever , vomiting , lethargy , irritability , and a bulging fontanelle in infants or a stiff neck in older children . Hib may also cause epiglottitis , which presents with fever , sore throat , and difficulty swallowing , talking and breathing .

Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide , mainly during the rainy season . Sporadic human infections with glanders -LRB- B. mallei -RRB- , occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists , horse butchers , and laboratory workers .
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown . Cases have been reported in dryer areas , like northeastern Brazil and north Iran . This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields . In Southeast Asia , it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water .

In the absence of vaccination , Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5 . The introduction of Hib vaccination has however been accelerating and by the end of 2009 , in 83 % of WHO Member States -LRB- 160/193 -RRB- , Hib is included in the national immunization schedule .
In the absence of vaccination , Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5 . Ten countries , all in Africa and Asia , accounted for an estimated 61 % of all these Hib deaths . Hib pneumonia is estimated to be responsible for around 16 % of pneumonia deaths in HIV-negative children , therefore Hib makes an important contribution to the high childhood mortality rates and low life expectancy of Sub-Saharan Africa .

Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative , cases have decreased significantly . There were 1,292 reported cases in 2010 , of which only 232 were in the endemic countries Afghanistan , India , Nigeria , and Pakistan . In endemic countries most cases are children aged < 3 years . In 2009 -- 2010 , 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus , notably hundreds of cases in Tajikistan . Most reported polio cases in 2010 -LRB- n 1,060 -RRB- were in nonendemic countries . Polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in Chad , Angola , Sudan , and the DRC .
