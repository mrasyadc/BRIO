Parotitis is present in 95 % of clinical cases . Infection and inflammation of the testicles -LRB- orchitis -RRB- occurs in up to 30 % of adult males but is rare before puberty . Orchitis results in testicular atrophy in 50 % of cases but rarely causes sterility . Adult women may rarely suffer inflammation of the ovaries -LRB- oophoritis -RRB- . The commonest nervous system manifestation of mumps infection is meningitis . Other rarer clinical complications include hearing loss , encephalitis , and pancreatitis .

Echinococcosis is restricted to the northern hemisphere , and is most commonly found in adults . In some areas there is a shift from a sylvatic to a synantropic cycle , including domestic dogs , as was seen in China and Alaska . Such a shift leads to a higher risk of infection in humans . The prevalence in dogs and cats is still very low in Europe , even in areas highly endemic for infection in foxes .

WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 . Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds . Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999 , WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world . Since the introduction to northeast America , the virus has spread to most regions in North America , Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and several cases in South America .

The mosquito becomes infected with MAYV during feeding on a viremic host . The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the mosquito . After a few days , depending on the ambient temperature , the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding .

ONNV is a mutant of CHIKV that appeared in 1959 in Uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of Africa , leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic . There was a small outbreak in Côte d'Ivoire in 1984 -- 1985 and again in 2003 , also described as Igbo-Ora virus and a small recurrence in Uganda in 1996 . Serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in Kenya in 1994 -- 1995 and in horses in Nigeria , but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with CHIKV antibody .
