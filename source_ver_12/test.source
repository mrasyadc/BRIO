Approximately 15 to 20 million people worldwide are believed to be infected. In Africa all HTLV and STLV subtypes are found, and phylogenetic research suggest that HTLV-1 originated in Africa about 27,000 years ago. HTLV-1 infection is more common in women and the prevalence increases with age, with a peak incidence around age 50. Among HTLV-1 carriers, the lifetime risk of developing HAM/TSP ranges from between 0.3% and 4%. For ATL, this risk is estimated to be 1% to 5% and for HTLV-1-associated diseases in general, including ATL, HAM/TSP, uveitis, polymyositis and arthropathy, the lifetime risk may be close to 10%. Japan, Africa, Caribbean islands and South America are the areas of highest prevalence, but the reasons for this are unknown. Most infections world wide are due to subtype HTLV-1a. Distribution of the infection is focal, e.g. Brazil, Japan, and Iran, where HTLV-1 is limited to certain areas of each country. On several Japanese islands the prevalence can reach 37%. Socioeconomic or genetic factors may contribute to the development of HTLV-associated infective dermatitis, since the disease has not been reported in HTLV-1 epidemic Japan. For non-endemic areas such as Europe and North America, HTLV-1 infection is mainly found in immigrants from endemic areas, their offspring and sexual contacts, among sex workers and IVDUs.
Mosquitoes, primarily Aedes and Ochlerotatus spp., secondarily Anopheles spp. Ae. triseriatus (eastern treehole mosquito) is the most important vector of LACV in the USA. LACV is abundant in forests with oak trees (basal holes are important breeding sites) and hickory hardwoods drained by rapid streams. Different species of cold-tolerant mosquitoes serve as vectors for JCV and SSHV.
Humans
By tick bite, blood transfusion; bone marrow for transplantation is routinely screened in endemic areas.
Wild and domestic canines, also skunks, raccoons, mongooses; vampire, frugivorous and insectivorous bats.
Rubella specific IgM or significant rise in antibody titer in paired samples; RT-PCR or virus isolation from throat swab, or other specimens in CRS.
By mosquito bite.
None.
Demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in Giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy; PCR tests have been developed for the different Leishmania species; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience. The Montenegro skin test is simple, sensitive and specific, but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections.
Hygiene, access to clean water, and sanitation. An effective vaccine is available; vaccination should be offered to high-risk groups (MSM, liver disease, travelers to endemic areas, IVDUs, outbreaks); passive immunization with immunoglobulins can be given as PEP within 2 weeks of the exposure. The virus remains viable for weeks at room temperature.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), an encapsulated Gram-positive bacterium, with > 90 serotypes based on capsular polysaccharide antigens. Approximately 23 serotypes are responsible for 90% if the infections in the developed world.
Avoid contamination of skin by potentially infected soil or water. There is no vaccine available.
Clean wounds, perform debridement and remove foreign objects. A one-off dose of im or iv human tetanus immunoglobulin removes unbound toxin but does not affect bound toxin. Metronidazole in large doses for 7–14 days to eradicate C. tetani infection. Since the effect of bound toxin may last for 4–6 weeks, prolonged supportive care is required. Tetanus does not induce immunity. Vaccination with tetanus toxoid is therefore indicated during treatment.
Tetanus spores enter the body through wounds and under anaerobic conditions, the spores germinate and produce toxin. The toxins are disseminated via the blood and lymphatic system and bind to nerve endings, preventing the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. This results in unopposed skeletal muscle contraction.
Consumption of raw or undercooked vector molluscs, infested vegetables or vegetable juice, or other fresh water related food.
Q fever has been described world wide, with the exception of New Zealand. Though small outbreaks are reported from tropical countries, serological studies do show that the prevalence of disease is higher there than in temperate regions. Most human outbreaks involve either goats or sheep. The largest global outbreak ever reported occurred in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2010, mainly in the southeast where there is a high density of dairy goat farms. The outbreak led to a high incidence of infections in people exposed to aerosols living in the vicinity of infected farms but had no occupational exposure. People living within 2 km of a farm had a much higher risk than those living > 5km away. The hospitalization rate was relatively high, 20% versus around 5% which is normally reported.
By insect bite.
Through inhalation of aerosolized microconidia from disturbed soil or guano. Also by inoculation and organ transplantation.
Humans.
Although SARS-like coronaviruses with very high genetic homology to SARS-CoV have been identified in masked palm civets, civets are thought to be a non-reservoir, spillover species. Horseshoe bats are thought to be the natural reservoir of the progenitor of the SARS virus.
SARS
Rotavirus, a non-enveloped double-stranded RNA virus within the Reoviridae family, is classified into 7 rotavirus groups (A–G) as determined by the antigenic properties of the VP6 capsid protein. Group A is most common in human disease, with B and C to a lesser extent. Subgroups and serotypes are determined by seroand genotyping the epitopes P and G, of the VP4 and VP7 outer capsid proteins, respectively. These proteins are relevant for vaccine efficacy.
Plasmodium falciparum, an intracellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa. Among the malaria parasites, P. falciparum causes the vast majority of mortality.
Antibiotic treatment with a macrolide antibiotic is mainly indicated to reduce communicability in those presenting within 3 weeks of onset. Hospitalization may be needed in severe causes for supportive care.
Isolation of C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans by culture and toxigenicity testing of strains at reference labs.
Malaria requires urgent treatment and type of treatment depends on disease severity and drug resistance in the region. Artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in the Thai–Cambodian border region. Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria: artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs); the choice of ACTs is based on the resistance levels of the partner medicine in the combination. Artemisinin and its derivatives should not be used as monotherapy. Severe malaria: artesunate iv or im; complete treatment with an ACT or artesunate plus doxycycline or clindamycin.
O’nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), an enveloped RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, closely related to chikungunya virus (CHIKV, see Chikungunya Fever map). Strains bear the names Gulu, Igbo-Ora, and SG650 viruses.
By airborne droplets from respiratory secretions of infected persons. Subclinical cases can transmit infection. Rubella virusmay be transmitted to the fetus if the mother is infected during pregnancy.
Humans are the only natural host. The parasite can be experimentally transferred to chimpanzees.
Ancylostomiasis, Necatoriasis, Uncinariasis, ground itch.
Supportive, including rehydration.
Cat liver fluke disease, foodborne trematodiasis
Hygiene, access to clean water and sanitation. An oral cholera vaccine is available which is safe and provides sustained protection of > 50% that lasts for 2 years in endemic populations. The vaccine does not protect against infections with O139 strains. Chemoprophylaxis for contacts may consist of tetracycline or doxycycline. Breast-feeding protects infants. Quarantine is ineffective. Infection results in limited protection against homologous strains, but there is no cross-protection. Cholera must be reported to national health authorities as small local outbreaks may become large epidemics.
C. burnetii is resistant to many disinfectants and extreme environmental conditions. The organism can survive in aerosols for 2 weeks and in soil up to 5 months. Prevention is targeted to those working with livestock, mainly sheep and goats; appropriate disposal of birth products; routine testing of risk animals; restricted movement of animals in infected regions; culling of infected animals; a human and veterinary vaccine is available in several countries; pasteurize milk.
Sudden onset of high fever (biphasic), chills, myalgia, arthralgia, severe headache, ocular pain, conjunctivitis, anorexia, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. Spleen and liver can be palpable, and pericarditis or myocarditis may be found. A few cases have a petechial or maculopapular rash. Prolonged convalescence may follow. Children may have a more severe syndrome with hemorrhagic manifestations, including a more pronounced rash, DIC, and GI bleeding; or CNS involvement including meningitis and encephalitis. Fatalities are rare.
Taeniosis: praziquantel. Neurocysticercosis: Treatment must be individualized case by case but could include cestocidal drugs (albendazole or praziquantel), symptomatic measures (antiepileptic drugs, oedema reducing drugs, ventriculoperitoneal shunt) and removal by neurosurgery (limited indications).
Soil, (decaying) vegetation, and ruminants. Humans and ruminants can carry listeria in their intestines.
By tsetse fly bite (day biters); blood transfusion, and congenital.
Serology (IgM ELISA, IFA) or by detection of OROV RNA in blood by RT-PCR.
Tree-hole-breeding forest mosquitoes: Aedes spp. in Africa, and Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. in South America. Transovarian transmission occurs in the mosquito and may be the way the virus survives in the years between cycles. The urban vector on both continents is Aedes aegypti.
Non-invasive GI listeriosis: fever, muscle aches, nausea and diarrhea. Invasive listeriosis: septicemia, meningoencephalitis, and perinatal listeriosis. Meningoencephalitis: headache, stiff neck (often absent), confusion, convulsions and coma (CFR: 20–30%). Infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth and infection of the newborn. Pregnant womenmost commonly haveflu-likesymptoms. Focalinfections in any organ may occur. Focal cutaneous and eye infections can occur after direct inoculation with contaminated tissue, usually occupational. Listerial gastroenteritis is uncommon.
Soil, animal hair, wool or hides, particularly goat skins contaminated with soil. Spores can germinate outside an animal under appropriate conditions.
Mild self-limiting dengue-like febrile illness, with headache, malaise, arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, maculopapular rash, and conjunctivitis. Other symptoms may include anorexia, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain.
Boutonneuse fever (group name for R.conorii infections: MSF, ISF, ITT), QTT and STT/NATT: mild febrile illness that may last up to 2 weeks, eschar at bite site with regional lymphadenopathy (in ISF, eschars are rare), generalized maculopapular erythematous rash on palms on soles after 4–5 days. The disease can be severe with a CFR up to 3%. ATBF is milder than other rickettsioses, fever and rash are less common, multiple eschars may be present with regional lymphadenopathy.
Among those infected, about 20% develop acute watery diarrhea, of which 10–20% develop severe watery diarrhea with vomiting, leading to severe dehydration which may be lethal if not treated. The CFR is typically below 5%, but in crowded refugee camps it can run as high as 50%.
Weil disease, swamp fever, cane cutters disease, hemorrhagic jaundice, swineherd disease.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a non-enveloped singlestranded RNA virus, genus Hepevirus, the single member in the Hepeviridae family. The virus can be classified into four genotypes (genotype HEV-1 to HEV-4), and > 24 subgenotypes (1a–1e, 2a–2b, 3a–3j, and 4a–4g). Avian isolates of HEV are now considered to be a separate genus. HEV was discovered in the 1980s as a result of a large water-borne non-A non-B hepatitis outbreak in India between 1978 and 1979.
Spherical, enveloped, negative sense RNA viruses forming a subgroup of the Bunyaviridae family. In the Americas, human pathogens belonging to the group are Guaroa virus (GROV), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), LaCrosse virus (LACV), and snowshoe hare virus (SSHV). Those reported to cause human disease in Europe or Asia are Inkoo virus (INKV), Tahyna virus (TAHV), and SSHV.
High fever with headache, chills, neck stiffness, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting developing into aseptic meningitis or encephalitis with disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, drowsiness, and stupor. Death occurs from respiratory complications or seizures. The case fatality rate is around 20%, but can be as high as 60%; 30% of those who survive suffer lasting damage to the central nervous system.
In 2000 it was estimated there were approximately 21,650,000 new S. Typhi cases and 216,500 deaths, with large regional variability. These estimates are based on limited data from mainly countries with a high incidence of disease. Typhoid fever incidence is highest among infants and children living in South Central and Southeast Asia and South Africa. Two seasonality patterns are observed: (1) higher incidence in warmer dry months leading to higher bacterial loads in the water, and (2) higher incidence in the rainy season, due to spillover from sewage to drinking water. Declines are seen in regions were living conditions have improved, mainly due to access to clean water and sanitation (see Water and Sanitation map).
Microscopy for eggs in stool (S. mansoni) or urine (S. haematobium) samples; quantification of eggs in stool by Kato–Katz method and in urine by standardized filtration techniques; PCR.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped RNA virus (hepacavirus) and belongs to theflaviviruses. The HCV genome is highly mutable. There are at least six HCV genotypes and several subtypes with differences in clinical presentation, geographic distribution and treatment response. HCV was discovered in 1989 as another cause of transfusion associated hepatitis (non-A non-B hepatitis).
From asymptomatic to fatal. Acute febrile illness with chills, headache, severe myalgia (with mild rhabdomyolysis), conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptoms. Less common findings are hepatomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, jaundice, and aseptic meningo-encephalitis. Pulmonary symptoms may occur varying from cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis, to adult respiratory distress syndrome. Weil disease is a severe form of leptospirosis and is characterized by jaundice, renal failure and hemorrhage with a CFR of 5–20%.
Mainly humans; rarely non-human primates and other mammals.
None.
Studies of unvaccinated populations in some western countries indicate that almost everyone will be infected with mumps by adulthood; however the epidemiology of mumps is less well characterized in developing countries. The true number of mumps cases is not known, since it is often a mild disease and reported cases probably represent fewer than 10% of all infections. There is geographic variation in circulating mumps virus genotypes, and there can be several genotypes circulating simultaneously in one area and shifts over time in predominant genotypes. Mumps vaccination is recommended at age 12–18 months and is included in the standardimmunization program ofmost developed countries, usually in a trivalent vaccine with measles and rubella (MMR vaccine). A booster dose in later childhood is also recommended for countries with a good immunization program. Several developed countries with a well-established mumps vaccination program have experienced significant outbreaks in young adults, who were too old to be included in the childhood immunization schedule and had not been exposed to natural infection due to an overall reduction in the transmission of mumps in the population. Other possible reasons for mumps outbreaks in vaccinated populations include a waning of vaccine-induced immunity and genotype mismatch between the vaccine strain and the wild virus. Since the complications of mumps are more common in affected adults compared to affected children, a shift in the average age of infection can lead to an increase in the number of observed complications. However, despite these issues, it must be remembered that comprehensive mumps vaccination programs are associated with a massive overall decrease in the burden of mumps morbidity.
By bite of the vector.
B. quintana multiplies in the louse’s intestine and is excreted in the feces. Body lice feed several times per day that leads to itchiness and scratching, by which the skin is inoculated with louses’ contaminated feces. Chronic B. quintana bacteremia facilitates infection in lice and further spread.
Vaccination of risk groups; eradicating carriage; hygiene; sanitation; access to clean water; pasteurization of dairy products; quality control and hygiene procedures for the food industry; exclude typhoid carriers from food handling.
Microscopy of respiratory secretions, pleural fluid, tissue or exudate in which detection of spherules containing endospores is diagnostic (double-walled structures, size 20–100 mm) fungal culture of sputum, blood, pus, and urine; coccidioidal serologic tests; cocciodin or spherulin skin test (not available in USA). Serology on CSF to diagnose meningitis.
Humans are viremic at a titer high enough to infect mosquitoes for 3 to 7 days post illness onset. The virus travels from the mosquito gut to the salivary glands in 5–7 days, after which it can infect another human by bite.
Culture (cysteine-enriched media) or PCR on specimens of affected tissues. Blood cultures are often negative. Testing should be done in a BSL-3 facility. Serology on acute and convalescent sera.
Via a bite or a scratch by an infected host animal. Human infection via S. moniliformis ingestion (milk, water, food) is known as Haverhill fever. Some streptobacillosis cases may occur by close contact with the oral flora of pet rats through kissing and sharing food. There is no person-toperson transmission.
Whitmore disease.
The disease is seasonal, generally coinciding with tick activity; there are peaks of incidence every 5–7 years in China. Europe and Russia have an estimated 12,000 cases per year (2007). In eastern regions the disease coincides with tick habitat in cold, moist forest, but tick ranges extend well beyond reported disease at both eastern and western geographical extremes. During the past two decades, new endemic foci and an increase in cases have been reported in many European countries, in spite of widespread vaccination of at-risk populations. In 1989, FE virus was isolated from Ixodes ovatus ticks and the blood of a febrile patient in Yunnan province, southwestern China. The virus may have completely different rodent hosts and tick vectors from those in northern China.
West Nile virus (WNV), a flavivirus, with an envelope and RNA plus-strand genome. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of full-length genomes has resulted in a division of WNV strains into four distinct lineages, with lineage 1 strains further separatedinto three clades (1a, 1b, and 1c). Kunjin virus and Murray Valley encephalitis virus are subtypes of WNV that are endemic in parts of Oceania.
Simian variola.
Freshwater snails: Semisulcospira, Thiara, Aroapyrgus, and others.
Rubella virus, a single-stranded RNA positive-sense rubivirus of the family Togaviridae.
Female phlebotomine sandflies (Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti, P.chadaudi, P. longipes, P. pedifer)
Humans (mainly L. donovani), wild Canidae (foxes, raccoon dogs, jackals, wolves), domestic dogs (mainly L. infantum/chagasi), and rodents.
Human–copepod–human. Adult female worm expels larvae through a hole in the skin of the leg or foot of an infected person into stagnant water where they are ingested by the vectors. The larvae become infectious in 2 weeks and when the vectors are ingested and digested, the larvae are freed and migrate into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen and thorax. There they mature into adults. Larvae are shed for 2–3 weeks, are viable in water for up to 5 days, and develop in the copepod for 2 weeks.
World wide, but close to elimination in the Americas and targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015. In the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95%, but is most often over 50%. Reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections. CRS is also grossly underreported. For example, it is estimated that over 45,000 CRS cases occur annually in Southeast Asia yet only an average of 13 CRS cases per year were reported to WHO between 2000 and 2009. Rubella is a public health concern because of CRS and in 1996 it was estimated that 110,000 CRS cases occurred annually in developing countries. Paradoxically, a poor rubella immunization program may actually increase the incidence of CRS if the burden of illness is shifted to young adults, where pregnancy is common. Therefore rubella immunization programs must achieve and maintain high immunization rates ( > 80%) or be supplemented by the immunization of women of childbearing age. In 2009 two-thirds of countries included a rubella containing vaccine in their national immunization schedule yet in many developing countries rubella vaccine has not been included because of lack of information on the burden of CRS, costs, and concerns about causing a paradoxical increase in CRS cases.
Trench fever, quintana fever, quintan fever, shinbone fever, shank fever, His-Werner disease, and Wolhynia fever.
Tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, or penicillins for 7 days have all been shown to be effective for treating TBRF. LBRF can be treated with a single dose of antibiotics. When initiating antibiotic therapy, watch closely for a Jarisch– Herxheimer reaction.
Symptomatic, there is no specific treatment.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), North American tick typhus, New World spotted fever, Tick-borne or tick typhus, Tobia fever (Colombia), Sao Paulo fever or ‘febre maculosa’ (Brazil), and fiebre manchada (Mexico).
Avoid exposure to feces of reservoir species wash hands, fruit and vegetables, periodically treat high-risk dogs, eliminate ownerless dogs. Praziquantel-containing baits have reduced infection in urban foxes and water voles in Switzerland and Germany. Eggs are highly sensitive to elevated temperatures and desiccation, but survive for months at freezing temperatures and are not affected by common disinfectants or ethanol.
Two licensed oral live attenuated rotavirus vaccines are available. Surveillance is needed to collect data on the burden of rotaviral disease and the circulating strains to assess the potential impact of vaccine introduction. Virus is shedded before and until 1 week after onset of illness and can survive for a prolonged period of time on hard surfaces, hands, and in water. Improved sanitation, access to clean water, and hygiene have not yet shown to reduce rotavirus disease incidence.
Humans are viremic at a titer high enough to infect mosquitoes for up to 5 days after infection. The virus travels from the mosquito gut to the salivary glands in 5–7 days, depending on the ambient temperature (extrinsic incubation period), after which it can infect another human during feeding.
Histoplasmosis may be divided into the following four types: (1) pulmonary histoplasmosis, (2) disseminated histoplasmosis, (3) cutaneous histoplasmosis, and (4) African histoplasmosis. Most infections are asymptomatic or mild and resolve without treatment. The acute phase begins with fever, malaise, chest pains and a dry cough. Chest X-ray findings are normal in 40–70% of cases. Severe infections result in mediastinitis, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and adrenal enlargement. Osteomyelitis is rare. Disseminated disease occurs in patients with altered cellular immunity such as individuals with AIDS and those receiving immunosuppressive medications. It presents with systemic complaints and multiple organ involvement: lung, spleen, bone marrow, adrenals, CNS and GI tract being the most affected. Disseminated histoplasmosis is fatal unless treated. Past infection results in partial protection. Reactivation is uncommon but may occur.
Humans are the main reservoir; non-human primates can be infected, rarely.
Serology (HEV IgM, IgG); HEV RNA detection in blood and stool by RT-PCR.
PCR on blood or skin biopsy, or IFA on the latter. Serology is unspecific due to cross-reactivity.
Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, Venezuelan equine fever, Mucambo virus fever.
During outbreaks: strict control on animal movements and slaughtering; health education of everyone who butchers, prepares, and cooks pork, including in their homes; wearing gloves to handle raw or uncooked pork, careful washing of hands and utensils. Adequate cooking essential; WHO recommends cooking pork to reach an internal temperature of 70 C, or until the juices are clear rather than pink.
An inactivated virus vaccine (not licenced) is limited available to protect laboratory workers, veterinarians and others ‘at risk.’ Livestock vaccines are available, but are not licenced in Europe or the USA. Animal movement should be banned during outbreaks. Protective clothing worn by those exposed to infected animals/tissue. All animal products (blood, meat and milk) should be thoroughly cooked before eating. Infection control for those taking care of severe human cases. Personal anti-mosquito precautions. Larviciding at mosquito-breeding sites. Early warning systems for RVF are in place that use satellite images and weather/climate forecasting data.
The highest global burden of CL is in the Old World. In the Americas, Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru have the highest burden of CL. In the New World, CL mainly occurs in forested areas, whereas in the Old World it is associated with semi-arid and desert regions. Transmision can also occur in deforested areas. Disease mainly occurs in those living or working in the forests of endemic areas. Outbreaks can occur during military training in the jungle or infrastructural projetcs in endemic areas. Also, travelers acquire the disease during visits to rural or jungle regions. Disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. Clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is probably related to the short flight range of sandflies.
Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. Generally, treatment is continued for at least 3 days after the patient is afebrile.
Eggs develop in water in 3–7 weeks, hatch producing miracidia which enter the intermediate snail hosts, in which they develop into cercariae. The cercariae encyst on water plants and develop to metacercariae. When ingested, the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum, where the flukes attach to the mucosa of the small intestine, mature, and start egg production in 2 to 3 months.
IgM ELISA; IgG cross-reacts with other alphaviruses. Confirmation needed by neutralization test, virus isolation, or a significant rise in specific antibody between acute and convalescent serum samples; RT-PCR.
The nematodes: Anisakis simplex, A. physeteris, Pseudoterranova decipiens, and Contracaecum spp. A. simplex and P. decipiens are the most important species for human disease. Anisakis larvae are whitish, tightly coiled, 1.5–2 cm in length, and difficult to see in fish flesh. Pseudoterranova larvae are 2–3 cm in length and red to brown in color.
The estimated prevalence of strongyloidiasis is between 30 and 100 million infections in 70 countries world wide; however, the accuracy of these estimates is uncertain due to poor performance of screening methods. Most cases are found in tropical and subtropical areas (warm, moist). Rarely, it is found in foci in North America and Europe. It is of significance in developed nations as it can cause hyperinfection in immunocompromised patients that have been infected years before in an endemic region. The most important risk factor for hyperinfection is corticosteroid therapy; other risk factors are: hematologic malignancies, malnutrition, alcoholism, HTLV-1 infection, and immunosuppressive medication (e.g. for organ transplantation). Interestingly, hyperinfection is not commonly seen in HIV-infected individuals in endemic countries.
Therapy is aimed at neutralizing the potent exotoxin, eradicating the organism, and providing supportive care. Immediate treatment with diphtheria antitoxin and iv antibiotics (penicillin or macrolide).
Tabanid adult female flies, mainly Chrysops silacea, C. dimidiata, and C. distinctipennis. These day-biting and bloodsucking flies breed in forested and damp environments (e.g. swamps or rotten vegetation). Other favorable environments are cocoa plantations. Chrysops are attracted by movement, dark objects, and smoke. The vector does not enter structures like homes or barns. Up to 18% of the vector population can be infected with L. loa in endemic areas.
Early Lyme disease is generally treated for 10–14 days, late Lyme disease for 21–30 days. Oral antibiotics commonly used are: doxycycline or amoxicillin. Patients with neurological or cardiac forms of illness may need iv ceftriaxone or penicillin.
Especially prevalent in pig-rearing regions of Southeast Asia, where it is estimated that 10 million people are infected. The disease is most common in lowlands where the snail host is present and it is common practice to fertilize water plants with pig or human feces. Disease spread is facilitated by heavy rainfall and extensive flooding, leading to fecal contamination of the water. Highest incidence and intensity of infection is found in 10 to14 year old children (no sex difference), probably because they pick and consume water plants when they play. In foci of parasite transmission, the prevalence of infection in children ranges from 57% in mainland China to 25% in Taiwan, and from 50% in Bangladesh and 60% in India to 10% in Thailand. Water morning glory (Ipomoea aquatica), water caltrop (Trapa bicornis), lotus (Nymphaea lotus), water cress (Neptunia oleracea), and water hyacinth (Eichhornia speciosa) are most responsible for human infection, but cysts also float on the surface and may be drunk.
Most infections are asymptomatic or mild. Symptoms are: abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, vomiting and weight loss, rarely anemia. Massive infections may result in intestinal obstruction. Migration of proglottids can cause cholecystitis or cholangitis. Proglottids can be seen in the stool.
Vivax malaria is the second most important malaria species after P. falciparum and accounts for 25–40% of the cases world wide with 132–391 million cases per year. Outside Africa it is the dominant species, mainly in Asia. The distribution is wider than P. falciparum as it is able to develop at lower temperatures and can form hypnozoites in human liver. The high prevalence of Duffy negativity in western Africa has influenced the epidemiology of P. vivax, as Duffy-negative people are apparently resistant to vivax malaria, although several reports suggest that Duffy-negative people can be infected with P.vivax. The disease burden is greatest in infants. In 2010, an autochtonous P.vivax case was diagnosed in north eastern Spain. Malaria was declared eradicated from Spain in 1964. P.vivax may have been transmitted by the local vector Anopheles atroparvus, which can transmit Asiatic P. vivax strains.
By arthropod bite handling or processing of infected animal carcasses or tissues, by ingestion of contaminated water, soil or food, or by inhalation of contaminated dust or aerosols.
Microscopy to detect microfilariae in finger-prick blood smears; immunochromatic test cards; ultrasound to locate ‘nests.’
Plasmodium knowlesi, an intacellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa. P. knowlesi is an Old World simian malaria parasite.
HBV disease has an acute and chronic form. 10% of children and 30–50% of adults present with symptoms of acute HBV infection similar to hepatitis A and last several weeks: fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, jaundice, dark urine, and light stools. Fever is often absent and arthritis and rash may be present. Chronic disease evolves to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma and eventually death. 90% of infants who are infected in their first year develop chronic infection. Only 10% of adults who acquire infection develop chronic disease, as the majority is able to clear HBV within 6 months. Differences in disease severity, risk of liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma are seen by age of infection, level of viral replication, level of inflammation, region and HBV genotype. Also co-infection with HDV leads to more severe chronic liver disease.
In the early 20th century diphtheria was the leading cause of death in children aged 4–10 years in Europe, and many countries experienced large diphtheria outbreaks during World War II. Childhood vaccination has now virtually eliminated diphtheria as a public health problem in most developed countries, and diphtheria cases reported to WHO have fallen by almost 93% between 1980 and 2008. The WHO has estimated that around 5,000 deaths from diphtheria occurred in 2004, with 4,000 of these in children under 5 years of age. However, a steady decline in the global number of reported diphtheria cases from 1980 was interrupted by a large recrudescence in the early to mid-1990s in the former Soviet Union. Since 1990, diphtheria outbreaks have also occurred in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and South America. Without periodic immunological boosting through vaccination or natural exposure to toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae, adults may become susceptible to infection. Epidemics may then occur, exacerbated by poor living conditions or the emergence of new toxigenic variants. This has led to the introduction of booster doses of toxoid in adolescents in some non-endemic countries.
Mumps is preventable by the use of live attenuated mumps virus vaccines. Various vaccine strains are available and may vary in immunogenicity and the incidence of adverse effects, such as fever, rash, parotitis, or meningitis.
Humans and possibly cats.
Ixodid wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni).
Avoid accumulations of bird or bat droppings such as are found in caves. The USA government provides a document, ‘Histoplasmosis: Protecting Workers at Risk’, with information on work practices and personal protective equipment.
There are three transmission cycles: (1) sylvatic or jungle, (2) intermediate or savannah, and (3) urban. All three cycles exist in Africa and the sylvatic and urban yellow fever occur in South America. The sylvatic cycle happens in tropical rainforests where monkeys are infected by mosquitoes, and pass the virus onto other mosquitoes that feed on them; sporadically humans can become infected when entering the forest for work. The intermediate cycle is present in the savannahs of Africa, resulting in small oubreaks in rural settlements. Urban yellow fever can lead to large outbreaks in humans when infected individualsintroduce the virus to the urban mosquito population (mainly Aedes aegypti), that subsequently can transmit to other humans.
Oroya fever: penicillin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracyclines are all effective, with ampicillin for secondary infections, but the case may still evolve to verruga peruana, which is treatable with streptomycin or rifampicin. Severe cases: ceftriaxone iv is used and blood transfusion in case of severe anemia. Verruga peruana: rifampicin or streptomycin. B. bacilliformis is intrinsically resistant to quinolones.
Bird–mosquito–bird, with accidental dead-end infections in humans, equines, and other vertebrate animals.
Typical skin ulcer, eschar, may develop at the site of the mite’s bite. Several days later fever, headache, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy may develop. Dry cough with signs of pneumonitis, jaundice, and meningoencepahlitis may occur. Scrub typhus severity and clinical presentation is probably strain dependent.
By mosquito bite. There is no person-toperson transmission.
Mosquitoes, principally canopy-dwelling Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. The virus has also been isolated from Psorophora, Mansonia and Culex spp.
After ingestion, the virus infects hepatocytes, resulting in periportal necrosis. The virus is shed via bile into the stool and contaminates the environment, leading to new infections in susceptible exposed individuals.
