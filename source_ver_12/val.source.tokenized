Immunization with tetanus toxoid -LRB- inactivated tetanus toxin -RRB- . Immunization of pregnant women protects infants from neonatal tetanus .
Hib is a common invasive bacterial infection that primarily causes pneumonia , meningitis , and bacteremia . Pneumonia due to Hib is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of bacterial pneumonia . Hib meningitis may present acutely or subacutely with fever , vomiting , lethargy , irritability , and a bulging fontanelle in infants or a stiff neck in older children . Bacteremia may be present with meningitis or pneumonia but may also occur without an obvious focus of infection . Hib may also cause epiglottitis , which presents with fever , sore throat , and difficulty swallowing , talking and breathing . Infections of soft tissue , bones , and joints with H. influenzae may occur .
Acute irregular fever , chills , sweating , arthralgia , headache , and depression . Evidence of localized suppurative infections may be found in liver , spleen , genitourinary tract , and osteo-articular -LRB- joints and sacrum -RRB- . Symptoms may last for months and vary from mild to severe and even fatal -LRB- CFR : < 2 % -RRB- .
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown . Antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign , or misdiagnosed and underreported . Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide , mainly during the rainy season . Cases have been reported in dryer areas , like northeastern Brazil and north Iran . This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields . In Southeast Asia , it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water . In northeast Thailand , 20 % of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis , which accounts for 39 % of fatal septicemias and 36 % of fatal community-acquired pneumonias . Up to 80 % of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes , chronic renal disease , or alcoholism , age , chronic infection , or immunosuppressive therapy . Sporadic human infections with glanders -LRB- B. mallei -RRB- , occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists , horse butchers , and laboratory workers .
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa , where it is estimated that 12 -- 13 million humans are infected . The prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age , and is more common in men as they are more exposed . Loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control . It has been proposed that areas where the Loiasis prevalence is > 20 % , are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment .
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome -LRB- HPS -RRB- , Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome , Four Corners disease .
Drain abscesses , iv ceftazidime , meropenem or imipenem followed by eradication treatment using cotrimoxazole , with or without doxycycline . Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an alternative for those with resistant strains or where co-trimoxazole is contraindicated . Also usually sensitive to piperacillin or ticarcillin with clavulanic acid . There is an up to 10 % relapse rate .
Rats and other rodents , dogs , cattle , and pigs are the most important zoonotic reservoirs of human infection .
WEEV was first isolated during an equine epizootic in California in 1930 . Eight years later WEEV was isolated from a fatal humanWEE case in California . TheWEEV distribution is limited to the Americas with human epidemics occurring in North America west of the Mississippi river and Brazil . WEEV does not occur at higher altitudes in the Rocky Mountains . In the USA it overlaps with eastern equine encephalitis virus -LRB- EEEV -RRB- in Texas , Indiana , Wisconsin , Tennessee , and Michigan . It is absent from Central America -LRB- except Veracruz , Mexico -RRB- . In South America , WEEV epizootics occur periodically in northern Argentina . The WEEV vector , Culex tarsalis , is associated with irrigated agriculture and stream drainages . The WEEV cycle in warmer regions is maintained and in colder areas it can be reintroduced by migratory birds or remain in an unknown reservoir host species . Between 1964 and 2005 , there were 639 confirmed human WEE cases in the USA . In temperate regions the disease is seasonal with cases appearing during the warmer summer months . The incidence declined to less than 10 cases per year since 1988 .

Human Immunodeficiency Virus -LRB- HIV -RRB- , an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus of the Lentivirus genus and Retroviridae family , is divided into two main species HIV-1 and HIV-2 . HIV-1 is more infectious and more virulent than HIV-2 and predominates globally , with HIV-2 transmission restricted to parts of Western and Central Africa .
Bilharziasis , Katayama fever or syndrome , urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis .
Polyarthritis and rash , epidemic polyarthritis , Barmah Forest virus disease , and Ross River virus disease , Murweh virus disease .
The mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic vertebrate host . The virus crosses the mosquito gut wall and replicates in the organs of the mosquito . After several days , the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding .
Humans and possibly other primates -LRB- chimpanzees -RRB- . Evidence of naturally occurring P. ovale in chimpanzees has been reported .
Hookworm eggs hatch in the soil and develop to infective larvae -LRB- L3 -RRB- that can penetrate the skin . After entering the host , the larvae migrate to the lungs , move up the trachea and swallowed . In the gastrointestinal tract the larvae mature to adult worms -LRB- both sexes -RRB- . After mating , the female hookworms produce up to 30,000 eggs per day that are shedded with the stools into the environment .

Together with tuberculosis and cryptococcosis , penicilliosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients in Southeast Asia . Though we could not find a report from Myanmar , it is expected to be present there . In northern Thailand it causes 15 % of the HIV-related diseases . Before the HIV epidemic it was a rare disease in immunocompromised patients residing in endemic areas in Asia . Cases of penicilliosis have been described world wide , mainly in HIV patients with a travel history to endemic regions . A single case has been described from Ghana where there was no clear travel history to Southeast Asia . The association between bamboo rats and human infection is unclear . There is an association between infection risk and doing agricultural work , suggesting that soil exposure is a risk factor . The disease has a seasonal pattern with more cases during the rainy season .
It is an occupational risk for those working in the environment in endemic regions -LRB- e.g. farmers , soldiers -RRB- . Dust control where feasible -LRB- e.g. paving roads -RRB- . Arthroconidia are resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can survive for many years in dust . Screening of organ donors for coccidioidomycosis in endemic areas . As the fungus is easily aerosolized it is a laboratory hazard .
Kala-azar -LRB- Hindi for black sickness -RRB- , black disease , dum-dum fever .
Rabies occurs in more than 150 countries and territories ; world wide , more than 55,000 people die of rabies every year ; 40 % of people who are bitten by suspect rabid animals are children under 15 years of age . Dogs are the source of 99 % of human rabies deaths , which is largely due to low rabies vaccination coverage of dogs in developing countries . Most cases of rabies in North America and Australia have been acquired from bats , often with no documented record of a bite . The USA was declared free of canine rabies transmission in 2007 . In the Americas , dog rabies control reduced human cases to 16 by 2009 . Every year , more than 15 million people world wide receive a preventive PEP regimen to avert the disease -- this is estimated to prevent more than 327,000 rabies deaths annually .
Vaccination of children with three doses of Hib conjugate vaccine from the age of 2 months , with a booster dose aged 12 -- 15 months . Since household contacts of confirmed cases of invasive Hib disease are at increased risk of disease , rifampicin prophylaxis is recommended for all household members if the household contains an infant or inadequately immunized children under the age of 3 years .
Deworming with mebendazole or albendazole ; repeat treatment in case eggs are still detected in feces . Iron supplementation to correct anemia .
Bartonella bacilliformis , a fastidious intracellular Gramnegative bacterium .
In the absence of vaccination , Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5 . In developed countries -LRB- prior to immunization -RRB- , Hib was the commonest cause of bacterial meningitis in young children , but in countries with high vaccination coverage Hib is now almost eliminated as a public health problem . In developing countries Hib meningitis is common but Hib pneumonia appears to be even more common , with pneumonia morbidity and mortality exceeding that of meningitis . In 2000 Hib is estimated to have caused around 8 million cases of severe invasive disease and 360,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age . Ten countries , all in Africa and Asia , accounted for an estimated 61 % of all these Hib deaths . Hib pneumonia is estimated to be responsible for around 16 % of pneumonia deaths in HIV-negative children , therefore Hib makes an important contribution to the high childhood mortality rates and low life expectancy of Sub-Saharan Africa . Global coverage with three doses of Hib vaccine was estimated at 28 % in 2008 , with overall coverage of around 90 % in the Americas , 65 % in Europe , 40 % in Africa , and less than 5 % in Asia and the Pacific . The introduction of Hib vaccination has however been accelerating and by the end of 2009 , in 83 % of WHO Member States -LRB- 160/193 -RRB- , Hib is included in the national immunization schedule .
Serology -LRB- acute and convalescent sera -RRB- using the microscopic agglutination test -LRB- MAT -RRB- . Isolation of leptospira from blood or CSF during first 10 days of illness and urine during the 2nd and 3rd weeks ; PCR may provide early diagnosis . Dark-field microscopy is not recommended .

Aquatic insects ; in southern Australia mosquitoes ; not yet fully understood .
Protection from vector bites by wearing permethrin-treated light-colored clothes and fly repellent on exposed skin . DEC can be used as prophylaxis , but should not be used routinely .
Only ardeid birds and pigs have a sufficient viremia to infect mosquitoes . The mosquito picks up the virus from the blood of a viremic host . After a few days , the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host when bitten . Humans are incidental and dead-end hosts as viremia does not reach sufficient levels to infect mosquitoes .
Fever , cough , hemoptysis , and pleuritic chest pain . Flukes may invade the brain and rarely the spinal cord , causing meningitis , intracranial hemorrhage , epilepsy , and paralysis . They may also cause acute and chronic inflammation of the pleura , pericardium , and mediastinum . Chest Xray findings are similar to tuberculosis . Complications include pleural effusion , pneumothorax , bronchiectasis , and pulmonary fibrosis .
Listeria monocytogenes , a Gram-positive rod-shaped intracellular bacterium . There are at least 13 serotypes , with serotypes 1/2a , 1/2b , and 4b causing most disease . L. ivanovii is a very rare enteric opportunistic human pathogen .

An inactivated vaccine is available . Specific hyperimmune globulin used in the past as prophylaxis after tick-bite may worsen the disease .
Serology -LRB- IFA , ELISA -RRB- or RT-PCR on bloodor CSF . Serology may cross-react with otherflaviviruses andlead to false-positives . Plaque Reduction Neutralization Tests -LRB- PRNT -RRB- and virus isolation are only done in specialized laboratories .
Tetanus is globally distributed but is more common in highly populated agricultural areas , and in warm and wet regions . In the late 1980s tetanus was estimated to cause around 1 million deaths per year , mostly in newborn infants . The current distribution of cases represents the coverage of tetanus immunization in children and adults . In countries with good vaccine coverage in children , adult cases may still be common , as natural immunity plays no role in the epidemiology of tetanus . The DTP3 Vaccination Coverage map shows coverage with the third dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine in childhood . The elimination of neonatal tetanus was set as a goal in 1989 and by mid2010 neonatal tetanus had been eliminated in 79 % -LRB- 153/193 -RRB- of WHO Member States . However , since C. tetani will always remain present in nature , tetanus will always remain a threat , and high levels of immunization must be maintained indefinitely .

Nipah virus : through contact with infectious body fluids , including bat saliva -LRB- on fallen fruit and in date palm sap -RRB- , or droplets from coughing infected pigs . In Bangladesh , half of reported cases between 2001 and 2008 were due to human-to-human transmission .
Small wild mammals such as rodents , snowshoe hares , deer and vector mosquitoes -LRB- venereal and transovarian transmission occur -RRB- . Dayfeeding chipmunks and squirrels are the principal amplifying hosts of LACV , as the main vector -LRB- Aedes triseriatus -RRB- only bites in daytime . For this reason , nightfeeding small mammals are rarely infected with LACV . The white-tailed deer is the main amplifying host for JCV -LRB- horses can also be an amplifying host -RRB- . Snowshoe hares and the arctic ground squirrel are the amplifying hosts of SSHV .
Principally wild birds in North America . Wild rodents , bats , reptiles , or amphibians may also be involved . Pheasants may serve as sentinels as they develop fatal disease . Chickens are more typically used as sentinels by detection of seroconversion .
Depends on portal of entry . The skin lesion is a characteristic black eschar surrounded by edema , usually on the head , forearms or hands , accompanied by malaise and fever , in 80 % of cases resolving spontaneously after 7 -- 10 days , but if left untreated it may evolve into fatal septicemia . GI anthrax produces nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fever , hematemesis , occasionally bloody diarrhea and often fatal septicemia and shock . Inhalation anthrax is rapidly progressive and starts with fever , malaise and mild cough and chest pain , evolving to acute respiratory distress , diagnostic mediastinal widening , cyanosis and shock . Untreated cutaneous anthrax has a CFR of 5 -- 20 % -LRB- < 1 % with treatment -RRB- , GI anthrax 25 -- 60 % , and inhalation anthrax 100 % -LRB- 75 % with treatment -RRB- .

Epidemic hepatitis , infectious hepatitis , infectious jaundice , catarrhal jaundice .
Historically , dracunculiasis was endemic in 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia , with an incidence of 3.5 million cases per year -LRB- 1986 -RRB- . An international control effort reduced that to just over 1,785 cases detected in five African countries by 2010 : Mali , Ghana , South Sudan , Chad , and Ethiopia . Nearly 95 % of the cases are reported from South Sudan . Additionally , Niger reported 3 imported cases from Mali . Chad did not report cases for more than 10 years when an outbreak occurred with 10 cases in 2010 . In Mali and Southern Sudan , violence has interfered with the eradication campaign , but Ghana and Ethiopia are close to eradication . Ghana diagnosed their last indigenous case in May 2010 . Dracunculiasis mainly affects poor communities without a safe portable water supply and is mainly limited to remote nomadic communities . There is a marked increase in infection in the dry season when stagnant pools are the only source of water . Most cases are young -LRB- working -RRB- adults who may be exposed to contaminated water sources more frequently . There is no particular age or sex predilection . Countries free of transmission neighboring endemic countries should remain alert for imported cases and take adequate preventive measures .

There are two different groups of etiologic agents : fungi and bacteria . Fungal mycetoma is called eumycetoma , and at least 34 fungal species have been implicated . The fungi Madurella mycetomatis and Pseudallescheria boydii are the most common fungal causative agents of eumycetoma . Bacterial mycetoma is called actinomycetoma and at least 14 actinomycetes have been implicated , of which the bacterial species of Nocardia , Streptomyces and Actinomadura are the most common causative agents of actinomycetoma .
Rodents , principally rats and sylvatic ground squirrels : marmots , susliks , and prairie dogs . Rabbits , camels , carnivores , and domestic cats may also be infected .

In 1988 , the WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative -LRB- GPEI -RRB- . The Americas were certified polio-free in 1994 , the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and Europe in 2002 -LRB- in 2010 , there was importation of polio into Europe -RRB- . The GPEI has four main strategies to stop transmission of the wild poliovirus : -LRB- 1 -RRB- high infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral poliovirus vaccine -LRB- OPV -RRB- in the first year of life ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- supplementary doses of OPV to all children under 5 years of age during SIAs ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- surveillance for wild poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all acute flaccid paralysis -LRB- AFP -RRB- cases among children under 15 years of age ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- targeted campaigns once wild poliovirus transmission is limited to a specific focal area . To be certified polio-free , three conditions must be met : -LRB- 1 -RRB- there are at least 3 years of zero polio cases due to wild poliovirus ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- disease surveillance efforts in countries meet international standards ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- each country must illustrate the capacity to detect , report , and respond to ` imported ' polio cases . Oral live attenuated polio vaccines can give rise to circulation of vaccinederived polioviruses and rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis . For this reason , efforts are underway to develop affordable options for inactivated polio vaccination .
Tick to mammalian host to tick for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma ; trematode to aquatic host to trematode for Neorickettsia . Human is a dead-end host for all . During the eclipse phase of both HME and HGA infection , the blood remains potentially infectious by blood transfusion .
Supportive with pain management .
The precise mechanism is unclear : probably by aerosol spread of nasal secretions from a case to respiratory mucosa of close contacts . M. leprae can not cross intact skin . The relative risk for leprosy disease in household contacts is 8 to 10 for multibacillary -LRB- lepromatous -RRB- leprosy and 2 to 4 for paucibacillary -LRB- tuberculoid -RRB- leprosy .
Gradual onset of malaise , headache , and retro-orbital pain , conjunctivitis , fever , and sweats , followed by prostration . Petechiae on the soft palate are frequent , on the body with ecchymoses less frequent . In severe cases : epistaxis , hematemesis , melena , hematuria , and gingival hemorrhage . Enceplalopathy , intention tremors , depressed deep tendon reflexes , bradycardia , and hypotension with shock are common . Infection during pregnancy can result in abortion . Convalescence may be prolonged . CFR due to these viruses , even after intensive hospital treatment , can be as high as 33 % .
Brucellosis is a common zoonosis with approximately 500,000 new cases per year world wide . The disease occurs mostly in areas where it is common to consume unpasteurized dairy products -LRB- soft cheese -RRB- and where poor veterinary health systems exist . The main Brucella infecting species vary by region . Incidence is highest in males with occupational exposure . The highest incidences are recorded in Mediterranean countries , Middle East , Central America , and Central Asia . Five of 10 countries with highest incidences are in the Middle East , with Syria leading . Many of the high-incidence countries were formerly part of the Soviet Union . Since their independence the veterinary health system has deteriorated , leading to an increase in brucellosis cases . In the USA it is mainly reported in Hispanics eating imported infected food . The disease is not considered highly endemic in South America . Data from Brazil is lacking , despite high cattle densities in this country -LRB- see Livestock map -RRB- . Many western European countries have brucellosis-free status . Mediterannean European countries implemented eradication campaigns , but still a high prevalence exists , especially in the Balkan peninsula . In eastern Europe the disease is limited to veterinarians .

CHIKV belongs to the same antigenic complex as Mayaro , Ross River , and o'nyong-nyong viruses . Phylogenetic analysis suggests an African origin about 500 years ago , with spread to Asia within the last century .
By tick bites , except for N. sennetsu , which is probably transmitted through ingestion of uncooked , parasitized aquatic hosts . No person-to-person spread except by blood transfusion .
Measles has a worldwide distribution , but is eliminated from the western hemisphere through vaccination . Measles deaths world wide fell by 78 % from an estimated 733,000 in 2000 to 164,000 in 2008 ; all regions but one have achieved the United Nations goal of reducing measles mortality by 90 % , however , it remains the leading cause of vaccinepreventable deaths in children and there are fears of a resurgence if vaccination falters for lack of resources . WHO figures for 2008 were 282,000 reported cases , with many thousands more unreported . Some 58 % of countries have 90 % or more vaccine coverage , adequate to stop transmission , but endemic countries have case fatality rates of up to 30 % in places . Most measles deaths -LRB- > 95 % -RRB- occur in countries with a per capita income of < US$ 1,000 . Measles-free countries still have imported cases and limited outbreaks in subpopulations with low or no vaccination coverage -LRB- e.g. religious communities -RRB- . Measles is being considered for global elimination or even eradication .

Barmah Forest virus -LRB- BFV -RRB- and Ross River virus -LRB- RRV -RRB- , enveloped RNA viruses , genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae . An early isolate of BF from Queensland was initially named Murweh virus . There are two topotypes of Ross River virus , from eastern and western Australia ; a third , in northeastern Australia , has not been found since the mid-1970s .
Tularemia has six characteristic clinical syndromes , depending on the site of infection : ulceroglandular -LRB- commonest -RRB- , glandular , oropharyngeal , pneumonic , oculoglandular , and typhoidal . Clinical signs include sudden onset of high fever , chills , generalized aches , and chronic ulcer at the bite site -LRB- ulceroglandular -RRB- . From the primary site , lymphatic spread to regional lymphnodes . Further hematogeneous dissemination to other organs . CFR for Type A -LRB- ulcero -RRB- glandular disease is < 2 % if treated promptly -LRB- 5 to 30 % if not treated -RRB- . In the acute septic form -LRB- typhoidal -RRB- of the disease , lymphadenopathy and ulcer are absent , and the CFR is high -LRB- 30 -- 60 % -RRB- . Oculoglandular disease is rare . Ingestion of infected material may result in oropharyngeal or GI tularemia . In the oropharyngeal form signs are : throat pain , large tonsils , pseudomembrane , and enlarged cervical lymph nodes . Symptoms in GI tularemia range from mild persistent diarrhea to extensive intestinal ulcers and death . Pneumonic tularemia occurs after inhalation of bacteria , or secondary from other entry sites and may progress to severe pneumonia , respiratory failure , and death .

The vector becomes infected with OROV by feeding on a viremic host . The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the insect . After a few days , depending on the ambient temperature , the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding . Jungle cycle : OROV is transmitted among sloths , marsupials , primates , and birds by the mosquitoes Aedes serratus and Culex quinquefasciatus . Urban cycle : OROV is transmitted to humans by midges -LRB- Culicoides paraensis -RRB- .
Leprosy control is achieved by timely detection and treatment of new cases . BCG vaccination provides variable protection : from 34 % to 80 % . Chemoprophylaxis and quarantine are not recommended . M. leprae bacilli remain viable for 9 days in dried nasal secretions and about 6 weeks in moist soil .
Soil , decaying vegetation .
Gastric anisakidosis : findings depend on where in the gastrointestinal tract the ingested larvae embed . Gastric anisakidosis is the predominant form with acute severe gastric pain , nausea , and vomiting and sometimes hematemesis . Intestinal anisakiasis can cause abdominal pain , obstruction , peritonitis , ulceration , and bleeding . Anisakis-associated hypersensitivity is increasingly being reported and varies from acute urticaria to anaphylaxis . Pharyngeal anisakiasis is rare with pharyngeal irritation as the main symptom .

Complications occur in 10 -- 15 % , including GI bleeding -LRB- most common -RRB- , intestinal perforation , and typhoid encephalopathy .
The disease is thought to have originated in the tropics and subtropics of Africa and Asia . WHO reported 213,036 leprosy cases at the beginning of 2009 . Although the worldwide prevalence has declined in the last two decades , the incidence has remained the same . India had the most new cases in 2008 -LRB- 134,000 -RRB- , followed by Brazil -LRB- 39,000 -RRB- , and Indonesia -LRB- 17,000 -RRB- . Males are affected more than females -LRB- 2:1 -RRB- ; young children are rarely infected . Epicurves for PL show a peak at age 15 followed by a trough at age 20 . WHO considers that leprosy has been eliminated as a public health problem in any country when the prevalence is less than 1 case per 10,000 population . In 2007 , the DRC and Mozambique achieved that status . Also India reported that their national prevalence is below 1/10 ,000 . However , pockets of high endemicity still remain in some areas within those countries . Decreased prevalence without a reduction in incidence maylead to an increase of cases as countries may be less committed to control them once they meet elimination status . Foci in Brazil are found in the Amazonian jungle , but also in arid areas . Poverty and crowded dwellings are important risk factors . Leprosy in North America and Europe has declined to zero cases in line with improvement in living conditions .
South American blastomycosis , Brazilian blastomycosis , Lutz -- Splendore -- Almeida disease .

Buruli ulcer is named after Buruli county in Uganda , where the disease was common in the 1960s . The disease is reported in 30 countries with tropical climates , but it may occur in some temperate regions . West Africa is the most affected region . Typical Buruli endemic regions are areas with slow-flowing or stagnant water . Flooding due to deforestation or the construction of dams , and irrigation systems such as rice fields , can lead to outbreaks . Outbreaks have also been associated with mining activities in Africa , due to creation of pits with stagnant water . In southern Australia several coastal towns have reported local outbreaks . It is unclear what triggered these outbreaks . World wide , mainly children are susceptible to Buruli ulcer disease .

A generally mild and short-lived illness with fever , coryza , conjunctivitis , lymphadenopathy , and a fine maculopapular rash beginning on the face later spreading to the trunks and limbs . Postauricular , occipital or posterior cervical lymphadenopathy may precede the rash by 5 -- 10 days . Around half of rubella infections are subclinical and constitutional symptoms may be minimal in children . Arthropathy may occur , especially in young women . The most important clinical consequence of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome -LRB- CRS -RRB- , which may result from intra-uterine infection in thefirst 16 weeks of pregnancy . CRS is a severe disease characterized by deafness , cataract , cardiac abnormalities , and a range of neurological impairments .
Anthrax has a worldwide distribution . Livestock vaccination , antibiotic treatment , and quarantaine regulations lead to a strong decline in anthraxinfections in domestic lifestock . Anthrax occurs mainly in rural areas in countries where there is no livestock vaccination and no veterinary control of slaughtered animals.There is a seasonal variation in animal disease with an increase in cases during hot dry weather . Anthrax is an occupational hazard for people who process contaminated animal tissues . GI anthrax occurs when infected tissue is ingested . Of note is the terrorist distribution of anthrax powder by mail in the USA in 2001 , which killed 5 people and produced sickness in 17 .

Clinical evident disease is more common in age group 15 -- 44 years , with following symptoms : fatigue , fever , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , jaundice , dark urine , and light stool . Pregnant women are at risk for severe disease , including fulminant hepatitis and death . In immunocompromised persons -LRB- e.g. transplant recipients or users of immune-modulating therapy -RRB- chronic infection has been reported .
The diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical features . The bacterium is usually not cultured from wounds and a positive culture does not confirm the diagnosis .
Compatible clinical features , a characteristic MRI -LRB- pulvinar sign -RRB- and the exclusion of other neurological diseases , are usually sufficient to diagnose ` probable vCJD . ' Definitive diagnosis of vCJD is by neuropathological examination of the brain , usually at postmortem .
None . Diagnosis is made by clinical examination .

Tacaribe complex viruses are spherical or pleomorphic , enveloped arenaviruses containing two single-stranded RNA molecules , with four distinct lineages -LRB- A , B , C , and a recombinant RecA -RRB- . Out of more than 20 known arenaviruses , only the following have been associated with human disease : Chapare , Guanarito , Junin , Machupo , Sabia , and Whitewater Arroyo viruses . All South American hemorrhagic fever viruses , except Whitewater Arroyo virus , are classified as high-priority bioterrorism pathogens . Other Tacaribe complex arenaviruses are capable of infecting humans and possibly cause disease .
Culture is the gold standard but is insensitive . PCR is more sensitive than culture . Serology may be helpful in patients presenting 3 weeks or more after cough onset , when both culture and PCR are likely to be negative .
90 % of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic ; 10 % develop invasive-intestinal disease -LRB- colitis -RRB- , and < 1 % extra-intestinal disease -LRB- liver abscess -RRB- . Amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps , weight loss , and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea ; most patients are afebrile . Amebic colitis rarely progresses to necrotizing colitis , ameboma , and toxic megacolon . Amebic colitis affects children and adults equally , but mainly males . Amebic liver-abscess mainly occurs in men aged 18 to 50 years , for unknown reasons . E. moshkovskii can cause non-invasive diarrhea .

It is estimated that 37 million people are infected worldwide , 97 % of them in Africa , and remaining in small foci in Central and South America and Yemen . Onchocerciasis was imported into Latin America by the slave trade . Onchocerciasis prevalence is related to the proximity to riverine breeding sites of black flies , with the highest disease burden in communities adjacent to rivers . Prevalence of infection rises with age until around 20 years , after which infection profiles vary between geographical region and sex . Higher rates of morbidity are reported in men . This variation canbe explainedby heterogeneity in age , gender , and occupational exposure to vectors .
Sudden onset of fever lasting 2 -- 7 days , sometimes biphasic , severe headache , myalgia , arthralgia , retro-orbital pain , anorexia , nausea , vomiting and a maculopapular rash -LRB- not easily seen on dark skin -RRB- . Most cases recover . Minor occurrence of petechiae , epistaxis , or gingival bleeding may be seen . Serious hemorrhagic manifestations , like a severe drop in blood platelets , indicate dengue hemorrhagic fever -LRB- DHF -RRB- , that can progress to dengue shock syndrome -LRB- DSS -RRB- and death . Infection with any serotype results in lasting homologous immunity , but little cross-immunity to other serotypes . Cross-immunity may exacerbate , rather than diminish , disease severity when infected with a new serotype ; DHF leading to DSS can occur as a secondary infection with a different serotype , but DHF/DSS has also been reported in primary infections . CFR for DHF is up to 20 % , for untreated DSS up to 50 % , and 1 -- 2 % if correctly treated .
The first human P. knowlesi case acquired in nature was detected in 1965 in Malaysia . P. knowlesi malaria is widely distributed across Sarawak and Sabah in Malaysian Borneo and extends to the state of Pahang in Peninsular Malaysia . P. knowlesi malaria cases have also been acquired in Thailand , Myanmar , Singapore , and the Philippines . The distribution and incidence of P. knowlesi malaria is yet unknown . Bases on current knowledge on the vector and reservoir , human knowlesi malaria is likely not rare in areas inhabited by the natural macaque hosts and the vectors . Humans working in the vicinity of forests are considered at risk . Deforestation now also brings humans in semi-urban areas into contact with reservoir hosts . Interestingly , P. knowlesi has been used in the past as a pyretic agent for the treatment of patients with neurosyphilis .
Half of the infected patients are asymptomatic and those with symptoms usually have mild disease . The most common presentations of acute Q fever are pneumonia , hepatitis , and isolated fever . Other symptoms are neurological -LRB- headache , confusion , peripheral neuropathy -RRB- , sore throat , chills , sweats , rash , and non-productive cough . Proportion of people presenting with pneumonia or hepatitis varies by region and immune status . CFR : 1 -- 2 % . Chronic Q fever occurs 1 to 20 years after acute infection and most often presents as endocarditis in patients with pre-existing heart disease -LRB- valve abnormality -RRB- .
The incidence of Noma and the prevalence of survivors of Noma are not well known . In 1998 , WHO estimated that 770,000 people had been affected in the past and survived the affection , and that 140,000 new cases were reported each year , of which 100,000 were between 1 and 7 years old and living in Sub-Saharan Africa . An estimation of the global incidence based on epidemiological field work in north-west Nigeria indicates 30,000 to 40,000 new cases per year . It occurs predominantly in debilitated and malnourished children , especially in underdeveloped countries . Peak incidence is at age 1 -- 4 years , the period of growth retardation in deprived children . The etiology is multifactorial : malnutrition , concurrent infections with malaria or measles , bad oral hygiene , severe diarrhea and severe necrotic ulcerative gingivitis are risk factors . In developed countries sporadic cases occur in immune-compromised patients , neonates , HIV-positive and diabetic patients .
Amphotericin B iv or itraconazole . Long-term azole maintenance treatment is required in HIV patients to prevent relapses .
Supportive .
There is strong epidemiological and laboratory evidence for a causal relation between vCJD and the BSE agent . In the UK , the primary epidemic has been associated with dietary exposure to BSE-infected bovine material during the BSE epidemic in the late 1980s to mid-1990s , before effective controls to prevent the BSE agent entering the human food supply were put into place . Most people who have developed vCJD have lived in or visited the UK during this time period . The behavior of the vCJD agent under laboratory conditions is also very like that of BSE . There is a strong host genetic component , with certain variants of the prion protein gene being much more susceptible to vCJD
Viremic reservoir host to mosquito during feeding , then after an extrinsic cycle of a few days , the virus is transmitted to a new reservoir host during feeding .
By mosquito bite -LRB- Anopheles spp . -RRB- ; transmission has been described in needle sharing IVDUs and blood transfusion .
Sudden onset fever , frontal headache , backache , diarrhea and a rash ; usually resolves without sequelae ; fatalities are rare and the result of hemorrhage or meningoencephalitis . ILEV and NRIV can cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks . CVV rarely causes encephalitis , with only one fatal case reported in the USA in 1995 .
Treatment of uncomplicated B. quintana bacteremia is with a macrolide -LRB- erythromycin , azithromycin -RRB- or doxycyclin . In case of endocarditis 4 -- 6 months of therapy is recommended in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin or gentamicin for the first 2 -- 3 weeks . Heart valve replacement may be needed .
Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne diseasein both North America and Europe , where its incidence is increasing . Incidence is seasonal , corresponding to increased vector activity during summer . The three Borrelia species differ in geographic location , vectors , and clinical manifestations : B. burgdorferi ss is present both in North America and Europe , but is absent from Asia ; B. garinii andB . afzelii occur in Europe and Asia . A recent study showed that B. garinii is the main genotype in China . Data of B. burgdorferi presence are lacking for South America , Sub-Saharan Africa , South and Southeast Asia . In the USA the disease is focal : most cases come from limited areas in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions . In the Baltic region , disease rates are several fold higher than in the USA . Incidences vary , ranging from 0.3 / 100,000 in the UK to 130/100 ,000 in Austria . Climate change , more housing in wooded areas , and expanding populations of deer , and small rodents may be responsible for the increase in Lyme disease cases . None of the mammal species identified as reservoir hosts and none of the transmitting ticks are present in Australia .
Cutaneous anthrax : penicillin , ciprofloxacin or doxycycline po ; severe anthrax -LRB- GI or inhalation -RRB- : ciprofloxacin iv preferred . Clindamycin can inhibit toxin production .

Surgical extraction of adult worms from the eye . Diethylcarbamazine -LRB- DEC -RRB- is filaricidal but can cause SAEs in patients with heavy infection . SAEs can be reduced by coadministering antihistamines or steroids . Alternative : albendazole with a lower risk of SAEs in case of heavy infection .
Hendra virus : pteropid bats are the primary reservoir of Hendra virus and are asymptomatic . The viruses can be isolated from their reproductive tracts and urine . The epidemiological reasons for the emergence of Hendra virus infection in horses are not clear . All human cases had close contact with infected horses . Nipah virus outbreaks have occurred only in South Asia and may be associated with the bat-breeding season . In Malaysia , it was hypothesized that the bats fed on fruit trees in pig farms , and that fallen fruit contaminated with bat saliva containing Nipah virus was eaten by pigs , who became infected . Nipah viruses have been isolated from bats in Cambodia and Thailand , and a high seroprevalence has been found in fruit bats in NW India , in the absence of reported pig or human disease . In Bangladesh , there is epidemiologic evidence of bat -- human transmission without an intermediate livestock host , and of human -- human transmission . Young boys who gather fruit from the trees are at higher risk of disease . Also drinking palm sap from trees is a potential risk factor . Antibodies to henipaviruses have been found in fruit bats in Madagascar -LRB- Pteropus and Eidolon sp . -RRB- and in Ghana -LRB- Eidolon sp . -RRB- , but in the absence of virus isolation or RNA detection , it is not possible to know which virus is involved . No human or animal cases have been reported in Madagascar or in Africa .

WHO -LRB- 2010 -RRB- estimates that there are over 120 million infections world wide , with 40 million patients incapacitated or disfigured by the disease , principally in India and Sub Saharan Africa . 90 % of the infections are due to W. bancrofti . Chronic manifestations mainly occur in the elderly . About 27 million have hydrocele -LRB- men -RRB- and 16 million have lymphedema or elephantiasis of theleg -LRB- mostly women -RRB- . Asia and South America have lower Bancroftian filariasis prevalences -LRB- below 8 % -RRB- than Sub Saharan Africa -LRB- up to 37 % -RRB- and Pacific Island -LRB- up to 48 % -RRB- regions . Within areas of low prevalence , pockets of high prevalence may exist -LRB- e.g. Reciffe , Brazil -RRB- . In the Americas there is only active transmission in four countries and mainly affects the poor and slum inhabitants . China has been declared non-endemic for lymphatic filariasis since 2007 and Korea in 2008 , achieved by extensive control efforts . The vectors are still present and therefore there remains a risk of re-emergence .
Ova are excreted with the feces of infected animals , and develop into larvae which are ingested by squid and other invertebrates -- these in turn are ingested by fish which may be eaten raw by humans . Humans are accidental hosts .
Access to clean water and sanitation ; regular deworming ; use of closed footwear . Infection control in immunocompromised patients with hyperinfection . Immunocompromised patients who have been in endemic areas should be screened and treated if positive .
Sanitation to reduce contamination of vector snail habitat , together with mass treatment with praziquantel and health education .
Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative , cases have decreased significantly . There were 1,292 reported cases in 2010 , of which only 232 were in the endemic countries Afghanistan , India , Nigeria , and Pakistan . In endemic countries most cases are children aged < 3 years . In 2009 -- 2010 , 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus , notably hundreds of cases in Tajikistan . Most reported polio cases in 2010 -LRB- n 1,060 -RRB- were in nonendemic countries . Polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in Chad , Angola , Sudan , and the DRC . This illustrates the difficulties of the global polio eradication program . Risk is seasonal in the temperate climates , with highest risks during the warmer months .
` Classic ' trench fever is characterized by febrile attacks that last 1 to 3 days , with headache , shin pain , and dizziness . The attacks recur every 4 to 6 days , with succeeding attacks being less severe ; no deaths have been reported . ` Urban ' trench fever generally occurs generally in homeless people and clincal features are highly variable , including severe disease with endocarditis , non-specific symptoms with or without fever , and chronic asymptomatic bacteremia . Infection with B. quintana -LRB- or B. henselae -RRB- may also cause bacillary angiomatosis , usually in patients with HIV .

Reducing sexual transmission through the promotion ofmonogamy , condom use , male circumcision , and the detection and treatment of STIs ; raising awareness of individual HIV status through voluntary counseling and testing ; protecting IVDUs through needle/syringe exchange and methadone replacement programs ; reducing mother to child transmission through voluntary counseling and testing and the provision of ARVs .
Foxes -LRB- including urban foxes -RRB- are the definitive hosts , wild rodents -LRB- mainly Arvicolidae -RRB- , voles and lemmings are intermediate hosts . Foxes have extended their distribution into urban areas , partly due to a decrease in rabies deaths in foxes since rabies vaccination .
Small rodents -LRB- mice , voles , rats -RRB- and insectivores -LRB- shrews , hedgehogs -RRB- are the most common animal reservoirs of Borrelia , while larger animals -LRB- deer , livestock -RRB- serve as hosts for the tick vectors . Hares and birds may also serve as reservoirs . Ticks by trans-stadial transmission ; transovarial transmission in ticks is limited .
Vector control ; mosquito repellent ; insecticidetreated bed nets ; residual spraying of insecticides ; treatment of infected humans . Recently control measures are being upscaled in a malaria elimination effort . Morocco , United Arab Emirates , and Turkmenistan have been certified malaria free by WHO .
Hantaviruses , a large group of different , enveloped , single-stranded , negative-sense viruses with a tripartite RNA genome , that belong to the Bunyaviridae family . Hantaviruses are named after the Hantan River area in South Korea , where the first hantavirus -LRB- Hantaan -RRB- was isolated in the 1970s . Old World and New World hantaviruses share high similarity in their genome and have comparable life cycles . Currently , there is no consensus on the classification of hantaviruses . Old World hantaviruses shown on the map are : Dobrava -- Belgrade virus -LRB- DOBV -RRB- , Hantaan virus -LRB- HTNV -RRB- , Puumula virus -LRB- PUUV -RRB- , and Saaremaa virus -LRB- SAAV -RRB- . Seoul virus -LRB- SEOV -RRB- is not shown , it is world wide in major port cities .
Unknown . It has been proposed that bamboo rats may amplify infectious dispersal stages for human infections .
As mosquito vectors and wildlife reservoirs are widespread , control is not feasible ; personal anti-mosquito measures ; eliminating potential breeding sites -LRB- e.g. old tires -RRB- and filling of basal tree-holes with concrete .
By consumption of infected raw , salted , marinated , pickled or undercooked freshwater crabs and crayfish . Infected humans can excrete worm eggs in sputum and feces for up to 20 years . There is no person-to-person transmission .
It is endemic in tropical and subtropical climates , such as Papua New Guinea , South Africa , parts of India and Indonesia , and among the aborigines of Australia . Some cases have been reported in the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean . The disease may be related more to socioeconomic conditions than to racial or geographical factors . In some settings it is a common cause of chronic genital ulcers in HIV patients . In the USA , it is more common in African-Americans , of people in lower socioeconomic status , and those with poor hygiene . It has been hypothesized that the natural habitat of K. granulomatis is the intestine and that the skin is affected by direct contact during anal coitus , or indirectly through contamination of the genitals by fecal material . There is no gender difference in incidence ; most cases occur in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years . There are no reports of congenital infections , but cases have been reported in newborn and nursing babies ; the course of the disease is more aggressive during gestation . Donovanosis increases the risk of subsequent HIV infection .
Oral rehydration therapy -LRB- ORT -RRB- using reduced osmolarity ORS ; intravenous rehydration in severe cases . Antibiotics are only useful to prevent spread , as they do not affect the already released toxin .
Infected individuals shed bacteria into environment , contaminating water and food products that are subsequently ingested by other humans .
Human infection is associated with cold waters in the northern hemisphere . A 2005 estimate stated that 20 million people were infected world wide . It is common in communities , as in Japan , that have a habit of eating raw or undercooked fish . Risky fish dishes are sushi , sashimi , South American ceviche , fish carpaccio , salmon tartare , and salted or marinated fillets in Scandinavia or Baltic region . Historically , Finland and Alaska had a high disease prevalence , but this has decreased due to preventive measures . Women seem more at risk , probably due to being involved in meal preparation . The disease incidence is increasing in some countries such as Russia , South Korea , Japan , and Brazil . Cases are also reported from regions where diphyllobothriasis was expected to have been eliminated , such as Alpine lakes in Switzerland , northern Italy , and eastern France . It is not clear whether the cases reported in Hawaii and Brazil are autochthonous or from imported fish . D. nihonkaiense , present in Japan and far eastern Russia , has been reported from a patient who ate raw Pacific sockeye salmon -LRB- Oncorhynchus nerka -RRB- from British Columbia , Canada . D. pacificum -LRB- formerly D. arctocephalinum -RRB- is increasingly reported as a human parasite along the coast of South America . Infected fish can be transported to any part of the world for consumption .
Bartonella quintana -LRB- formerly Rochalimaea quintana and Rickettsia quintana -RRB- , a fastidious intracellular Gram-negative bacterium .
Recovery of S. pneumoniae from sputum , blood , CSF or other normally sterile fluids by culture or PCR . S. pneumoniae antigen test in urine .
Anti-mosquito precautions .
This is unknown at present . M. ulcerans has been found in biofilms on vegetation in swamps and other permanent wetlands , aquatic insects , snails , and fish . In Australia , some land animals , particularly native possums , have been found to carry M. ulcerans in their gastrointestinal tracts .
