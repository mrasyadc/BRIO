Hib is a common invasive bacterial infection that primarily causes pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia. Hib meningitis may present acutely or subacutely with fever, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and a bulging fontanelle in infants or a stiff neck in older children. Hib may also cause epiglottitis, which presents with fever, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing, talking and breathing.

Acute irregular fever, chills, sweating, arthralgia, headache, and depression.
Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. Sporadic human infections with glanders (B. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. Cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern Brazil and north Iran. This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. In Southeast Asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water.

In the absence of vaccination, Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5. The introduction of Hib vaccination has however been accelerating and by the end of 2009, in 83% of WHO Member States (160/193), Hib is included in the national immunization schedule.
In the absence of vaccination, Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5. Ten countries, all in Africa and Asia, accounted for an estimated 61% of all these Hib deaths. Hib pneumonia is estimated to be responsible for around 16% of pneumonia deaths in HIV-negative children, therefore Hib makes an important contribution to the high childhood mortality rates and low life expectancy of Sub-Saharan Africa.

The Americas were certified polio-free in 1994, the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and Europe in 2002 (in 2010, there was importation of polio into Europe). The GPEI has four main strategies to stop transmission of the wild poliovirus: (1) high infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the first year of life; (2) supplementary doses of OPV to all children under 5 years of age during SIAs; (3) surveillance for wild poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases among children under 15 years of age; (4) targeted campaigns once wild poliovirus transmission is limited to a specific focal area.

In the UK, the primary epidemic has been associated with dietary exposure to BSE-infected bovine material during the BSE epidemic in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, before effective controls to prevent the BSE agent entering the human food supply were put into place. Most people who have developed vCJD have lived in or visited the UK during this time period.

Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne diseasein both North America and Europe. Incidence is seasonal, corresponding to increased vector activity during summer. Climate change, more housing in wooded areas, and expanding populations of deer, and small rodents may be responsible for the increase in Lyme disease cases.

Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, cases have decreased significantly. There were 1,292 reported cases in 2010, of which only 232 were in the endemic countries Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In endemic countries most cases are children aged <3 years. In 2009â€“2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus, notably hundreds of cases in Tajikistan. Most reported polio cases in 2010 (n 1,060) were in nonendemic countries. Polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in Chad, Angola, Sudan, and the DRC.
