SINV has been isolated from Africa , Eurasia , and Australia . The highest disease burden is in northern Europe -LRB- approximately between 60 and 64 N -RRB- and South Africa . Evolutionary studies show that SINV likely originated from South America , with subsequent spread to North America , Asia , and Australia , with later spread to Europe and Africa . Highest attack rates in Finland are in the eastern parts , and mainly in the age group 45 to 65 years . Epidemics tend to occur every 7 years in Finland , with the last epidemic in 2002 .

High-endemic areas generally have low disease rates as most infections occur in young children , who are usually asymptomatic . In developed countries with low endemicity , outbreaks are often caused by contaminated food products , like shellfish , which can concentrate virus , and other food products that are contaminated by an infected food handler .
High-endemic areas generally have low disease rates as most infections occur in young children , who are usually asymptomatic . High-endemic areas is defined as a region where > 90 % of the children < 10 years are already infected and most cases are asymptomatic .
