In the absence of vaccination , Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5 . The introduction of Hib vaccination has however been accelerating and by the end of 2009 , in 83 % of WHO Member States -LRB- 160/193 -RRB- , Hib is included in the national immunization schedule .
In the absence of vaccination , Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5 . Ten countries , all in Africa and Asia , accounted for an estimated 61 % of all these Hib deaths . Hib pneumonia is estimated to be responsible for around 16 % of pneumonia deaths in HIV-negative children , therefore Hib makes an important contribution to the high childhood mortality rates and low life expectancy of Sub-Saharan Africa .

CHIKV has been endemic in Africa for centuries , typically causing small epidemics in rural areas . In 2005 -- 2006 CHIKV spread from East Africa to virgin soil in the Indian Ocean Islands to produce epidemics affecting up to three-quarters of the population . CHIKV virus was imported into several European countries and caused a small outbreak with autochthonous transmission in northern Italy .

World wide , but close to elimination in the Americas and targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015 . In the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95 % , but is most often over 50 % . Reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections .

WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 . Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds . Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999 , WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world . Since the introduction to northeast America , the virus has spread to most regions in North America , Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and several cases in South America .
