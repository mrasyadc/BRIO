By tick bite; larval ticks are carried on migrating birds, which are refractory to the virus. The virus is also spread among veterinarians, farmers, shepherds, butchers, and slaughter-house workers by contact with the blood of infected livestock. Person-to-person spread is by contact with infectious body fluids of patients.
Acute: hepatomegaly, prolonged fever, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, cough, diarrhea, urticaria, lymphadenopathies, and arthralgias. Significant clinical improvement 3–5 days after specific treatment is diagnostic. Chronic (which may be asymptomatic and last for more than 10 years): biliary obstruction with upper abdominal pain, cholecystitis, cholangitis, and extrahepatic cholestasis. Liver fibrosis may be a complication of the infection.
Piscivorous (fish-eating) mammals, including: humans, dogs, cats, pigs, rats, and several species of wild animals. Humans can remain infected for several decades.
Herbivores become infected when they ingest spores during grazing on contaminated soil. When the animal dies, the soil under the carcase is contaminated. Omnivores and carnivores are infected by feeding on infected prey or carcases. Carnivores and humans are incidental hosts.
Mainly Ochlerotatus vigilax and Culex annulirostris. Aedes camptorhynchus, A. normanensis, A. notoscriptus, and Coquillettidia linealis are vectors in some circumstances.
Colorado tick fever is only present in North America (USA and Canada). In the USA, besides the states with human cases shown on the map, the virus has been isolated from ticks within the range of D. andersoni. The typical habitat of the tick and its rodent hosts is a south-facing slope above 1,500 meters with Ponderosa pine and shrubs on dry, rocky surfaces. Infection is seasonal, coinciding with the period of greatest tick activity in early summer. Human cases can be detected from March to September in the Rocky Mountain region, USA. Most human cases are males, aged 20–29 years, probably reflecting the frequency of outdoor activity in the mountains.
Through inhalation of aerosolized microconidia from disturbed soil or guano. Also by inoculation and organ transplantation.
Fecal–oral route, mainly via fecally contaminated water, but also via: food, materno-fetal, and transfusion of blood products. Direct person-to-person transmission is uncommon. Cycle: Human to human and occasionally animal to human. HEV is excreted from the liver into the stool via the bile and eventually into the environment. The amount of infectious virus in the stool is relatively low and explains a lower rate of transmission as compared to hepatitis A (see Hepatitis A map).
Avoid contamination of skin by potentially infected soil or water. There is no vaccine available.
It is endemic in tropical and subtropical climates, such as Papua New Guinea, South Africa, parts of India and Indonesia, and among the aborigines of Australia. Some cases have been reported in the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean. The disease may be related more to socioeconomic conditions than to racial or geographical factors. In some settings it is a common cause of chronic genital ulcers in HIV patients. In the USA, it is more common in African-Americans, of people in lower socioeconomic status, and those with poor hygiene. It has been hypothesized that the natural habitat of K. granulomatis is the intestine and that the skin is affected by direct contact during anal coitus, or indirectly through contamination of the genitals by fecal material. There is no gender difference in incidence; most cases occur in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years. There are no reports of congenital infections, but cases have been reported in newborn and nursing babies; the course of the disease is more aggressive during gestation. Donovanosis increases the risk of subsequent HIV infection.
Personal anti-mosquito precautions. Adulticide spraying is practiced in areas where horse cases appear. A human vaccine against only the North American strain is available for laboratory personnel.
Rodents, principally rats and sylvatic ground squirrels: marmots, susliks, and prairie dogs. Rabbits, camels, carnivores, and domestic cats may also be infected. Cats can also develop pneumonic plague. The desert regions of Central Asia contain endemic plague foci where the great gerbil is the main host.
Tick to mammalian host to tick for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma; trematode to aquatic host to trematode for Neorickettsia. Human is a dead-end host for all. During the eclipse phase of both HME and HGA infection, the blood remains potentially infectious by blood transfusion.
Standard louse control and personal tick protection. Chemoprophylaxis may be used for bite victims.
Microscopic examination of sputum for eggs (acid-fast staining destroys eggs), and examination of feces after using concentration techniques; ELISA for serology.
Ingested E. histolytica non-motile cysts will excyst in the gastrointestinal tract and develop to motile trophozoites that can penetrate the gut mucosa. In the colon, the trophozoites encyst and the cysts are excreted with the feces.
The distribution of RMSF and R. parkeri rickettsiosis is limited by the tick vector distribution. Average annual RMSF incidence of the disease in the USA was 2.2 cases per million between 1997 and 2002, and approximately 250–1,200 cases are reported each year. Many cases of RMSF may actually have been caused by other rickettsial agents, as was seen with R. parkeri. Many rickettsiae of unknown pathogenicity are present in ticks and new disease causing agents are still being discovered. RMSF in the USA follows a seasonal pattern with most cases in warmer months, when ticks are most active. RMSF cases are usually found in rural areas, and less commonly in urban areas. Residing in wooded regions or areas with high grass and exposure to dogs increases the risk of RMSF. RMSF is sporadic and rarely occurs in clusters.
Snail–human–snail. Infected humans shed eggs into the water, which hatch into larvae (miracidia) that enter snails and develop into motile larvae (cercariae). The cercariae are shed into the water and penetrate the skin of humans in the water, enter the bloodstream and settle in the liver. When matured to adult male and female worms, they migrate to the abdominal veins (S. mansoni, S. intercalatum, S. guineensis) or pelvic veins (S. haematobium), mate and produce eggs. Snails remain infectious for up to 3 months, humans for more than 10 years.
Microscopy of stained smear from a bubo, sputum or CSF shows characteristic ‘safety-pin’ shape; serology (IFA; ELISA); rapid dipstick test. Culture takes about 4 days.
Detection of trypanosomes in blood, lymph, or CSF after concentration; IgM ELISA, IFA, PCR. A card agglutination trypanosomiasis test (CATT) is available for T. b. gambiense but not T. b. rhodesiense.
Freshwater snails: Semisulcospira, Thiara, Aroapyrgus, and others.
Humans.
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa, where it is estimated that 12–13 million humans are infected. The prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age, and is more common in men as they are more exposed. Loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control. It has been proposed that areas where the Loiasis prevalence is > 20%, are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment.
Reducing sexual transmission through the promotion ofmonogamy, condom use, male circumcision, and the detection and treatment of STIs; raising awareness of individual HIV status through voluntary counseling and testing; protecting IVDUs through needle/syringe exchange and methadone replacement programs; reducing mother to child transmission through voluntary counseling and testing and the provision of ARVs.
Doxycycline for all patients. Rifampicin may be useful for HGA in younger children and pregnant patients.
Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne diseasein both North America and Europe, where its incidence is increasing. Incidence is seasonal, corresponding to increased vector activity during summer. The three Borrelia species differ in geographic location, vectors, and clinical manifestations: B. burgdorferi ss is present both in North America and Europe, but is absent from Asia; B. garinii andB. afzelii occur in Europe and Asia. A recent study showed that B. garinii is the main genotype in China. Data of B. burgdorferi presence are lacking for South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South and Southeast Asia. In the USA the disease is focal: most cases come from limited areas in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions. In the Baltic region, disease rates are several fold higher than in the USA. Incidences vary, ranging from 0.3/ 100,000 in the UK to 130/100,000 in Austria. Climate change, more housing in wooded areas, and expanding populations of deer, and small rodents may be responsible for the increase in Lyme disease cases. None of the mammal species identified as reservoir hosts and none of the transmitting ticks are present in Australia.
Diphyllobothriosis, Dibothriocephaliasis, broad or fish tapeworm infection
Small (6–18 mm long) trematode liver fluke of dogs, cats, and some other fish-eating mammals:Opisthorchis felineus in Europe and northern Asia, O. viverrini in Southeast Asia. Both species live in bile ducts.
Breakbone fever.
For C. philippinensis: eggs are passed in the stools of humans and fish-eating birds; after ingestion by freshwater fish, larvae hatch, penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the tissues. Ingestion of raw or undercooked fish results in infection of the human and bird host. The adults of C. philippinensis reside in the mucosa of the human small intestine, where the females lay eggs. Released larvae can cause autoinfection, which may progress to hyperinfection.
Serology (IgM ELISA, IFA); RT-PCR. Virus isolation is difficult.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped RNA virus (hepacavirus) and belongs to theflaviviruses. The HCV genome is highly mutable. There are at least six HCV genotypes and several subtypes with differences in clinical presentation, geographic distribution and treatment response. HCV was discovered in 1989 as another cause of transfusion associated hepatitis (non-A non-B hepatitis).
There is a vaccine against Junin virus only. Targeted rodent control in houses, except for Junin virus, which is spread by rodents in the fields. Barrier nursing of cases.
C. burnetii is resistant to many disinfectants and extreme environmental conditions. The organism can survive in aerosols for 2 weeks and in soil up to 5 months. Prevention is targeted to those working with livestock, mainly sheep and goats; appropriate disposal of birth products; routine testing of risk animals; restricted movement of animals in infected regions; culling of infected animals; a human and veterinary vaccine is available in several countries; pasteurize milk.
There are three transmission cycles: (1) sylvatic or jungle, (2) intermediate or savannah, and (3) urban. All three cycles exist in Africa and the sylvatic and urban yellow fever occur in South America. The sylvatic cycle happens in tropical rainforests where monkeys are infected by mosquitoes, and pass the virus onto other mosquitoes that feed on them; sporadically humans can become infected when entering the forest for work. The intermediate cycle is present in the savannahs of Africa, resulting in small oubreaks in rural settlements. Urban yellow fever can lead to large outbreaks in humans when infected individualsintroduce the virus to the urban mosquito population (mainly Aedes aegypti), that subsequently can transmit to other humans.
Virus isolation from stool, CSF or oropharyngeal secretion, followed by typing (to determine if the virus is ‘wild type’ or a vaccine strain). Alternatively, the diagnosis can be established by serological testing.
Hepatitis B is a common disease world wide, despite the existence of a vaccine. The WHO estimates that globally 2 billion individuals have been infected, of which about 360 million have chronic disease. Yearly, it is estimated that there are 500,000 to 700,000 HBV associated deaths world wide. In high-endemic regions like Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Amazon basin, most individuals become infected during childhood (mother-to-child, or child-to-child). In developed regions, the prevalence is low and important routes of transmission are different, consisting mostly of unsafe sexual practices, IVDU, and occupational transmission in healthcare workers. Chronic HBV associated liver cirrhosis is more common in developed nations than in Southeast Asia, but the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is lower compared to Southeast Asia. It is not yet fully clear whether this is due to differences in HBV genotype or age of infection.
Whitmore disease.
Tick bite prevention by avoiding wooded and bushy areas with high grass and leaf litter, especially in summer months; insect repellents; minimize bare skin check for tick bites and remove them within 24 hours.
Hantaviruses, a large group of different, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense viruses with a tripartite RNA genome, that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. Hantaviruses are named after the Hantan River area in South Korea, where the first hantavirus (Hantaan) was isolated in the 1970s. Old World and New World hantaviruses share high similarity in their genome and have comparable life cycles. Currently, there is no consensus on the classification of hantaviruses. Old World hantaviruses shown on the map are: Dobrava–Belgrade virus (DOBV), Hantaan virus (HTNV), Puumula virus (PUUV), and Saaremaa virus (SAAV). Seoul virus (SEOV) is not shown, it is world wide in major port cities.
Early Lyme disease is generally treated for 10–14 days, late Lyme disease for 21–30 days. Oral antibiotics commonly used are: doxycycline or amoxicillin. Patients with neurological or cardiac forms of illness may need iv ceftriaxone or penicillin.
River blindness, onchodermatitis.
Congo fever, Congo–Crimean hemorrhagic fever, Central Asian hemorrhagic fever
Common unspecific symptoms are acute febrile illness with chills, sweats, nausea, headache, and vomiting; high fever with chills is more common in P. vivax than in P. falciparum malaria. Recent reports provide evidence that vivax malaria is not as benign as previously thought. P. vivax can lead to severe anemia, acute respiratory distress, liver failure, renal failure, and even cerebral malaria.
Human buccal flora.
Drain abscesses, iv ceftazidime, meropenem or imipenem followed by eradication treatment using cotrimoxazole, with or without doxycycline. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an alternative for those with resistant strains or where co-trimoxazole is contraindicated. Also usually sensitive to piperacillin or ticarcillin with clavulanic acid. There is an up to 10% relapse rate.
Mayaro virus (MAYV), an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, belonging to the Semliki Forest virus complex.
None. Diagnosis is made by clinical examination.
Cutaneous anthrax: penicillin, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline po; severe anthrax (GI or inhalation): ciprofloxacin iv preferred. Clindamycin can inhibit toxin production.
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control, disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas.
Pigs or humans ingest eggs from contaminated environment. Adult tapeworms will only develop in humans after eating raw or undercooked pork containing cysticerci. It takes 2 months for larvae to become an adult worm and produce eggs (up to 300,000 eggs per day). In pigs, eggs invade the general circulation via the intestinal wall and migrate to skeletal and heart muscles where they form cysticerci.
Infected individuals shed bacteria into environment, contaminating water and food products that are subsequently ingested by other humans.
Hard ticks, principally Ixodes scapularis (formerly I. dammini) and I. pacificus in North America, I. persulcatus and I. ricinus in Eurasia. In Russia, the principal vectors are I. persulcatus in the west and I. ricinus in the east.
Colorado Tick Fever Virus (CTFV), a prototype virus of the genus Coltivirus of the family Reoviridae; a spherical, enveloped virus with a double-stranded RNA genome of 12 segments.
Contamination of a break in the skin by bacilli in the environment, or by the bite of an infected aquatic insect or mosquito. Person-to-person transmission is rare.
Need to treat both P. ovale blood and liver stage with chloroquine (blood stage) and primaquine (liver stage).
A granulomatous fungal infection of the lung, skin, bone or genitourinary tract. Pulmonary infection may be acute or chronic. Acute: fever, cough and pulmonary infiltrate, resolving in 1–3 weeks. Chronic infection is more common and characterized by erythematous papules on the face and extremities, low-grade fever, and weight loss; pulmonary infection may cavitate. Occasionally bone, prostate, epididymis and central nervous system may be affected. Untreated disseminated or chronic pulmonary disease is generally fatal. The main differential diagnosis is tuberculosis.
Coxiellosis, Query fever.
FA staining of frozen skin sections taken from the nape of the neck, or postmortem brain tissue; RT-PCR on saliva, skin or brain biopsy or buccal swab; serology; cell culture or mouse inoculation from saliva, skin, or brain.
Poliovirus, an RNA enterovirus with three types; type 1 cases are most common, followed by type 3; wild type 2 disappeared in 1999. Rare cases of all three types occur in unimmunized contacts of children vaccinated with the Sabin live attenuated vaccine.
None.
Through contamination of penetrating wounds (e.g. by thorns, splinters). There is no person-to-person transmission.
This is unknown at present. M. ulcerans has been found in biofilms on vegetation in swamps and other permanent wetlands, aquatic insects, snails, and fish. In Australia, some land animals, particularly native possums, have been found to carry M. ulcerans in their gastrointestinal tracts.
SARS is thought to have emerged in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002 and within 6 months cases were detected in 26 countries, with local transmission occurring in 6. In total over 8,000 cases and almost 800 deaths were recorded and, remarkably, much of the global transmission of SARS can be traced to a single individual who disseminated infection at a hotel in Hong Kong. ‘Super spreading’ events (where one person infects an unusually large number of people), such as occurred at the Hong Kong Hotel, appear to be an important feature of SARS epidemiology. The precise circumstances and timing of the interspecies transfer of SARS-CoV remains unknown. Many of the early cases in Guangdong had epidemiological links to the wild animal trade but later the transmission of SARS was exclusively person-to-person with a large nosocomial element. Laboratory-accident associated cases in late 2003 and April 2004, and a cluster linked to the wild animal trade in January 2004, highlight the potential for the re-emergence of SARS.
ONNV is a mutant of CHIKV that appeared in 1959 in Uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of Africa, leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic. This large epidemic was remarkable because, in spite of the occurrence of millions of cases, no deaths were reported. It ended without a trace in 1962, reappearing as sporadic cases in Africa at rare intervals. In Nigeria in 1966 and 1969, cases were described as a new virus, IgboOra, later recognized as ONNV. There was a small outbreak in Côte d’Ivoire in 1984–1985 and again in 2003, also described as Igbo-Ora virus and a small recurrence in Uganda in 1996. Serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in Kenya in 1994–1995 and in horses in Nigeria, but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with CHIKV antibody. It is not known how or where the virus survives between outbreaks, but sequence data show very little variation between ONNV strains isolated in Uganda in 1959 and 1996–1997, suggesting that the virus persists, rather than undergoing repeated mutations from CHIKV (which has a non-human primate reservoir).
Gram stain and microscopy of cerebrospinal fluid, and culture. Latex agglutination tests for detection of group-specific capsular polysaccharide. PCR.
Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) using reduced osmolarity ORS; intravenous rehydration in severe cases. Antibiotics are only useful to prevent spread, as they do not affect the already released toxin.
Detection of spirochetemia in blood smears with dark-field or conventional microscopy; blood culture in special media or mouse inoculation; quantitative buffy coat (QBC) fluorescence; PCR.
Vector control; mosquito repellent; insecticidetreated bed nets; treatment of infected humans.
Crustaceans infected with metacercaria larvae are ingested by the reservoir host, excyst in the gut and migrate to the tissues, usually the lungs. There they encapsulate, mature, and lay eggs. Eggs enter the sputum which is coughed up and swallowed, then pass out in the feces into water and hatch in 2–4 weeks into miracidia larvae. These penetrate the body of the vector snail, where they develop in about 2 months into cercaria larvae which enter and encyst in freshwater crabs and crayfish.
Ova are excreted with the feces of infected animals, and develop into larvae which are ingested by squid and other invertebrates – these in turn are ingested by fish which may be eaten raw by humans. Humans are accidental hosts.
Mainly humans; rarely non-human primates and other mammals.
Acute irregular fever, chills, sweating, arthralgia, headache, and depression. Evidence of localized suppurative infections may be found in liver, spleen, genitourinary tract, and osteo-articular (joints and sacrum). Symptoms may last for months and vary from mild to severe and even fatal (CFR: <2%).
Microscopy for eggs in stool (S. mansoni) or urine (S. haematobium) samples; quantification of eggs in stool by Kato–Katz method and in urine by standardized filtration techniques; PCR.
None.
By tick bite, blood transfusion; bone marrow for transplantation is routinely screened in endemic areas.
Often asymptomatic in healthy individuals. Symptomatic cases: fever, chills, myalgia, fatigue, and jaundice, hemolytic anemia; severe cases: retinal infarctions, ecchymoses and petechiae, acute respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, DIC, liver and renal failure, and splenic rupture, with a mortality rate of 5–9%, higher in immunocompromised patients. The differential diagnosis is chloroquine-resistant malaria, Lyme disease, or human granulocytic anaplasmosis.
Isolation of agent from blood, urine, sputum, pus or skin lesions; direct immunofluorescence; serology. PCR may be of value on samples other than blood.
It is estimated that 17 million people are infected world wide and 91 million are at risk of infection. F. hepatica is endemic on all continents but is of particular public health importance in the Andean countries (especially Peru and Bolivia), Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Philippines, and western Europe (e.g. France, Portugal, and Spain). Infections with F. gigantica are restricted to Africa and Asia. Both species of fluke overlap in many areas of Africa and Asia, whereas F. hepatica is the major concern in the Americas, Europe, and Oceania. The rural areas of the Andean region of Peru and Bolivia have prevalence rates of up to 68%. Women are affected more than men, with higher prevalence rates, more severe infections, and more reported liver or biliary complications; children are affected more than adults. The main source of infection is the consumption of raw vegetables contaminated with metacercariae, such as watercress, salads, and contaminated water from irrigation channels. Pharyngeal fascioliasis may occur after ingestion of raw goat or sheep liver – a dish in some Middle Eastern countries.
Hendra virus: through contact with infectious body fluids, including urine, saliva, and nasal discharge, or during autopsy of infected horses. Nipah virus: through contact with infectious body fluids, including bat saliva (on fallen fruit and in date palm sap), or droplets from coughing infected pigs. In Bangladesh, half of reported cases between 2001 and 2008 were due to human-to-human transmission.
Freshwater snails: Oncomelania spp. for S. japonicum, Robertsiella spp. for S. malayensis, Neotricula spp. for S. mekongi.
High fever with headache, chills, neck stiffness, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting developing into aseptic meningitis or encephalitis with disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis, drowsiness, and stupor. Death occurs from respiratory complications or seizures. The case fatality rate is around 20%, but can be as high as 60%; 30% of those who survive suffer lasting damage to the central nervous system.
The only real reservoir is the tick. Viremia persists only for a few days in transmission competent vertebrates, rodents (mainly Apodemus spp.). Deer, birds, possibly marmots are not competent to transmit to ticks.
Inhalation of spores from disturbed soil. There is no person-to-person transmission.
None
PCR on blood or skin biopsy, or IFA on the latter. Serology is unspecific due to cross-reactivity.
HBV disease has an acute and chronic form. 10% of children and 30–50% of adults present with symptoms of acute HBV infection similar to hepatitis A and last several weeks: fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, jaundice, dark urine, and light stools. Fever is often absent and arthritis and rash may be present. Chronic disease evolves to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma and eventually death. 90% of infants who are infected in their first year develop chronic infection. Only 10% of adults who acquire infection develop chronic disease, as the majority is able to clear HBV within 6 months. Differences in disease severity, risk of liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma are seen by age of infection, level of viral replication, level of inflammation, region and HBV genotype. Also co-infection with HDV leads to more severe chronic liver disease.
Rodent–rodent, with humans as accidental dead-end hosts. Infected reservoir hosts are asymptomatic and excrete infectious virus in the urine.
In 2000 it was estimated there were approximately 21,650,000 new S. Typhi cases and 216,500 deaths, with large regional variability. These estimates are based on limited data from mainly countries with a high incidence of disease. Typhoid fever incidence is highest among infants and children living in South Central and Southeast Asia and South Africa. Two seasonality patterns are observed: (1) higher incidence in warmer dry months leading to higher bacterial loads in the water, and (2) higher incidence in the rainy season, due to spillover from sewage to drinking water. Declines are seen in regions were living conditions have improved, mainly due to access to clean water and sanitation (see Water and Sanitation map).
An inactivated virus vaccine (not licenced) is limited available to protect laboratory workers, veterinarians and others ‘at risk.’ Livestock vaccines are available, but are not licenced in Europe or the USA. Animal movement should be banned during outbreaks. Protective clothing worn by those exposed to infected animals/tissue. All animal products (blood, meat and milk) should be thoroughly cooked before eating. Infection control for those taking care of severe human cases. Personal anti-mosquito precautions. Larviciding at mosquito-breeding sites. Early warning systems for RVF are in place that use satellite images and weather/climate forecasting data.
Usually asymptomatic or mild. Diarrhea alternating with constipation, vomiting and anorexia, edema of the face, abdominal wall and legs, ascites. Heavy worm loads may cause bowel obstruction. Eosinophilia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and secondary anemia may occur.
Via a bite or a scratch by an infected host animal. Human infection via S. moniliformis ingestion (milk, water, food) is known as Haverhill fever. Some streptobacillosis cases may occur by close contact with the oral flora of pet rats through kissing and sharing food. There is no person-toperson transmission.
Minute hard ticks: Ixodes ricinus in Eurasia, possibly Hemaphysalis longicornisin Korea, I. ovatusin Japan. I. scapularis (formerly I. dammini) in eastern North America, possibly I. dentatus in the central USA, I. pacificus in California and Washington state, USA.
Streptobacillosis: Streptobacillus moniliformis (formerly Actinobacillus muris, Haverhillia multiformis), a Gramnegative, non-motile pleiomorphic rod-like bacterium. Spirillosis: Streptobacillosis: Streptobacillus moniliformis (formerly Actinobacillus muris, Haverhillia multiformis), a Gramnegative, non-motile pleiomorphic rod-like bacterium.
Rats and other rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are the most important zoonotic reservoirs of human infection.
Consumption of raw, undercooked, dried, salted, or pickled freshwater fish. There is no direct person-to-person transmission.
Clean wounds, perform debridement and remove foreign objects. A one-off dose of im or iv human tetanus immunoglobulin removes unbound toxin but does not affect bound toxin. Metronidazole in large doses for 7–14 days to eradicate C. tetani infection. Since the effect of bound toxin may last for 4–6 weeks, prolonged supportive care is required. Tetanus does not induce immunity. Vaccination with tetanus toxoid is therefore indicated during treatment.
Humans. Asymptomatic carriage of N.meningitidis in the oropharynx is common, although carriage rates vary widely by geographic and epidemiological setting. The carrier state is immunizing and development of meningococcal disease is associated with recent acquisition.
Principally wild birds in North America. Wild rodents, bats, reptiles, or amphibians may also be involved. Pheasants may serve as sentinels as they develop fatal disease. Chickens are more typically used as sentinels by detection of seroconversion.
Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), an enveloped, spherical, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. WEEV is believed to have descended from an ancestral recombinant derived from eastern equine encephalitis virus and Sindbis virus.
Amphotericin B desoxycholate and/or azole antifungals; surgery to remove foci.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), Korean Hemorrhagic Fever, Hemorrhagic Nephrosonephritis, Nephropathia epidemica
Vivax malaria is the second most important malaria species after P. falciparum and accounts for 25–40% of the cases world wide with 132–391 million cases per year. Outside Africa it is the dominant species, mainly in Asia. The distribution is wider than P. falciparum as it is able to develop at lower temperatures and can form hypnozoites in human liver. The high prevalence of Duffy negativity in western Africa has influenced the epidemiology of P. vivax, as Duffy-negative people are apparently resistant to vivax malaria, although several reports suggest that Duffy-negative people can be infected with P.vivax. The disease burden is greatest in infants. In 2010, an autochtonous P.vivax case was diagnosed in north eastern Spain. Malaria was declared eradicated from Spain in 1964. P.vivax may have been transmitted by the local vector Anopheles atroparvus, which can transmit Asiatic P. vivax strains.
None.
Francisella tularensis tularensis (Type A), F. tularensis holarctica (Type B), F. tularensis mediasiatica, Gram-negative non-motile intracellular coccobacilli that infect macrophages. Type A is highly virulent and divided into two clades: Francisella tularensis tularensis (Type A), F. tularensis holarctica (Type B), F. tularensis mediasiatica, Gram-negative non-motile intracellular coccobacilli that infect macrophages.
Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. Generally, treatment is continued for at least 3 days after the patient is afebrile.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an enveloped RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. CHIKV belongs to the same antigenic complex as Mayaro, Ross River, and o’nyong-nyong viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests an African origin about 500 years ago, with spread to Asia within the last century.
Praziquantel is recommended; alternative: oxamniquine for S. mansoni, metrifonate for S. haematobium.
Amphotericin B iv or itraconazole. Long-term azole maintenance treatment is required in HIV patients to prevent relapses.
Most infections are asymptomatic or mild. Symptoms are: abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, vomiting and weight loss, rarely anemia. Massive infections may result in intestinal obstruction. Migration of proglottids can cause cholecystitis or cholangitis. Proglottids can be seen in the stool.
Rodent control; those with occupational exposure to rodents (e.g. sewage workers) should wear personal protective clothing; avoid close contact with reservoir animals, including pets; prophylaxis with penicillin or doxycycline following rat bite.
Avoid accumulations of bird or bat droppings such as are found in caves. The USA government provides a document, ‘Histoplasmosis: Protecting Workers at Risk’, with information on work practices and personal protective equipment.
The sandfly Lutzomyia verrucarum. Preferred habitat: narrow river gorges at elevations between 500 and 3,200 meters.
Environment (soil) to human. Fungal spores are inhaled and convert to the pathogenic yeast form in the lung from where they can disseminate to other organs.
Personal anti-mosquito precautions; there is no vaccine for WEE.
Small wild mammals such as rodents, snowshoe hares, deer and vector mosquitoes (venereal and transovarian transmission occur). Dayfeeding chipmunks and squirrels are the principal amplifying hosts of LACV, as the main vector (Aedes triseriatus) only bites in daytime. For this reason, nightfeeding small mammals are rarely infected with LACV. The white-tailed deer is the main amplifying host for JCV (horses can also be an amplifying host). Snowshoe hares and the arctic ground squirrel are the amplifying hosts of SSHV.
Humans are viremic at a titer high enough to infect mosquitoes for up to 5 days after infection. The virus travels from the mosquito gut to the salivary glands in 5–7 days, depending on the ambient temperature (extrinsic incubation period), after which it can infect another human during feeding.
None.
Mosquitoes, principally canopy-dwelling Haemagogus and Sabethes spp. The virus has also been isolated from Psorophora, Mansonia and Culex spp.
Treatment of uncomplicated B. quintana bacteremia is with a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin) or doxycyclin. In case of endocarditis 4–6 months of therapy is recommended in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin or gentamicin for the first 2–3 weeks. Heart valve replacement may be needed.
About 60% of exposures result in asymptomatic infection. Symptoms range from benign pulmonary infection (fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea), night sweats, anorexia and weight loss to progressive pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease involving skin, bones and/or joints, the central nervous system, and other organ systems. Most patients with primary disease recover spontaneously and have life-long immunity to re-infection. Chronic and disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to 5% of cases. Meningeal infection occurs in less than 1% of extrapulmonary cases and requires life-long treatment.
Probably non-human primates; the virus has been isolated from monkeys in Panama and French Guiana, also in the USA from a north-bound migratory bird. Antibody has been found in domestic animals and other vertebrates.
Not completely understood; most Bunyamwera viruses are likely maintained in nature involving a transmission cycle with various small mammals (mainly wild rodents) as amplifying hosts and mosquitoes. African rodents replicate BUNV and develop viremia. Livestock (goats, sheep, cattle), horses and rodents are hosts for GERV as shown by seroprevalence studies. Amplifying hosts for CVV are mainly large mammals (caribou, deer, horses, sheep).
Contact with infected animal tissue. Cutaneous anthrax: direct skin inoculation during processing of contaminated animal hides, hair, wool, or animal hide products. Gastro-intestinal (GI) anthrax: Contact with infected animal tissue. Cutaneous anthrax: direct skin inoculation during processing of contaminated animal hides, hair, wool, or animal hide products.
In 1988, the WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). The Americas were certified polio-free in 1994, the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and Europe in 2002 (in 2010, there was importation of polio into Europe). The GPEI has four main strategies to stop transmission of the wild poliovirus: (1) high infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the first year of life; (2) supplementary doses of OPV to all children under 5 years of age during SIAs; (3) surveillance for wild poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases among children under 15 years of age; (4) targeted campaigns once wild poliovirus transmission is limited to a specific focal area. To be certified polio-free, three conditions must be met: (1) there are at least 3 years of zero polio cases due to wild poliovirus; (2) disease surveillance efforts in countries meet international standards; and (3) each country must illustrate the capacity to detect, report, and respond to ‘imported’ polio cases. Oral live attenuated polio vaccines can give rise to circulation of vaccinederived polioviruses and rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. For this reason, efforts are underway to develop affordable options for inactivated polio vaccination.
By tick bites, except for N. sennetsu, which is probably transmitted through ingestion of uncooked, parasitized aquatic hosts. No person-to-person spread except by blood transfusion.
As mosquito vectors and wildlife reservoirs are widespread, control is not feasible; personal anti-mosquito measures; eliminating potential breeding sites (e.g. old tires) and filling of basal tree-holes with concrete.
Smallpox vaccine is protective, but not a feasible solution in the remote forest habitat where monkeypox is endemic. Hospital personnel should isolate patients and take infection control precautions.
Microscopy of respiratory secretions, pleural fluid, tissue or exudate in which detection of spherules containing endospores is diagnostic (double-walled structures, size 20–100 mm) fungal culture of sputum, blood, pus, and urine; coccidioidal serologic tests; cocciodin or spherulin skin test (not available in USA). Serology on CSF to diagnose meningitis.
Eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies, mature in about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on water temperature, and hatch ciliated larvae (coracidia). Coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans (copepods). The copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host, typically small fish. The larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae. Larger predator fish (e.g. pike, burbot, perch) ingest the smaller infected fish upon which the plerocercoid larvae migrate to the flesh of these larger fish that serve as third intermediate hosts harboring larvae. Humans and larger mammals acquire the disease by eating these larger fish raw or undercooked. The larvae mature into adult tapeworms that attach to the small intestinal wall by scolex and develop eggfilled proglottids that detach. Up to 1 million eggs per day per worm are passed in the feces, 2–6 weeks after infection.
By airborne droplets from or contact with nose and throat secretions of infected persons, very high from 4 days before to 4 days after rash appears, or with fomites contaminated with those secretions. Droplets remain infectious for several hours, longer under conditions of low humidity. Measles virus is highly contagious.
A generally mild and short-lived illness with fever, coryza, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and a fine maculopapular rash beginning on the face later spreading to the trunks and limbs. Postauricular, occipital or posterior cervical lymphadenopathy may precede the rash by 5–10 days. Around half of rubella infections are subclinical and constitutional symptoms may be minimal in children. Arthropathy may occur, especially in young women. The most important clinical consequence of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), which may result from intra-uterine infection in thefirst 16 weeks of pregnancy. CRS is a severe disease characterized by deafness, cataract, cardiac abnormalities, and a range of neurological impairments.
Clostridium tetani, a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium. The spores can remain viable in the environment for years. C. tetani produces a highly potent exotoxin, tetanospasmin, which is responsible for the clinical features of tetanus.
Detection of virus in respiratory specimens, stool or blood by RT-PCR; virus isolation; serology by IFA or ELISA. Specimen processing and testing should be performed under strict biosafety measures (BSL-3).
By mosquito bite. Experiments demonstrated human to human transmission with the mosquito as vector, but there is no direct human-to-human transmission.
Bartonella quintana (formerly Rochalimaea quintana and Rickettsia quintana), a fastidious intracellular Gram-negative bacterium.
P. ovale initally was thought to be limited to Sub-Saharan Africa, Papua New Guinea, eastern Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is actually more widely distributed, and is reported in the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent, and various parts of Southeast Asia. P. ovale has not yet been reported in South America. In general, P. ovale is relatively uncommon, though in West Africa prevalences above 10% are observed. Also, infections are most common in children <10 years. There is likely underreporting due to underdiagnosis. Due to the short duration of parasitemia and low parasite loads, P. ovale is regularly ‘missed’ in cross-sectional surveys.
Personal protection from sandfly bites (e.g. protective clothing, insecticide-treated bednets, residual insecticiding of breeding places).
By bite of the female sandfly (usually at dusk and at sundown, often indoors); rarely by blood transfusion or transplacental. There is no direct person-to-person transmission.
During bloodmeal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.
Soil, animal hair, wool or hides, particularly goat skins contaminated with soil. Spores can germinate outside an animal under appropriate conditions.
Measles virus, a single-stranded RNA negative-sense morbillivirus, family Paramyxoviridae.
Among those infected, about 20% develop acute watery diarrhea, of which 10–20% develop severe watery diarrhea with vomiting, leading to severe dehydration which may be lethal if not treated. The CFR is typically below 5%, but in crowded refugee camps it can run as high as 50%.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, Four Corners disease.
Sheep liver fluke disease, pharyngeal fascioliasis.
By insect bite.
Plasmodium knowlesi, an intacellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa. P. knowlesi is an Old World simian malaria parasite.
Anti-mosquito precautions.
Rarely by tick bite.
Sudden onset of fever lasting 2–7 days, sometimes biphasic, severe headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and a maculopapular rash (not easily seen on dark skin). Most cases recover. Minor occurrence of petechiae, epistaxis, or gingival bleeding may be seen. Serious hemorrhagic manifestations, like a severe drop in blood platelets, indicate dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), that can progress to dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death. Infection with any serotype results in lasting homologous immunity, but little cross-immunity to other serotypes. Cross-immunity may exacerbate, rather than diminish, disease severity when infected with a new serotype; DHF leading to DSS can occur as a secondary infection with a different serotype, but DHF/DSS has also been reported in primary infections. CFR for DHF is up to 20%, for untreated DSS up to 50%, and 1–2% if correctly treated.
Humans. Loa loa also infects some monkeys but the human and simian cycles seem to be independent.
Transmission to humans occurs by rubbing infected louse feces into abraded skin or into the conjunctivae.
Uncomplicated malaria: acute febrile illness with headache, chills, sweats, nausea, and vomiting; hepatosplenomegaly. Findings of severe malaria can be: cerebral malaria (confusion, seizures, impaired consciousness to coma), hemolysis, severe anemia, hypotension, renal failure, metabolic acidosis and death. Often high parasite counts are found in patients with severe malaria ( > 5% infected erythrocytes).
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. Antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign, or misdiagnosed and underreported. Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. Cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern Brazil and north Iran. This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. In Southeast Asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water. In northeast Thailand, 20% of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis, which accounts for 39% of fatal septicemias and 36% of fatal community-acquired pneumonias. Up to 80% of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal disease, or alcoholism, age, chronic infection, or immunosuppressive therapy. Sporadic human infections with glanders (B. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.
Food-borne and transplacental (mother to child). Ingestion of L. monocytogenes occurs commonly world wide. Development of the disease depends on the host immunity.
Tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, or penicillins for 7 days have all been shown to be effective for treating TBRF. LBRF can be treated with a single dose of antibiotics. When initiating antibiotic therapy, watch closely for a Jarisch– Herxheimer reaction.
By animal bite through saliva commonly or scratch (rarely). Infected livestock do not bite typically, but may infect a person through their saliva. Very rare: licks upon mucosal surfaces; aerosols in bat-infested caves; person-toperson transmission via organ/tissue transplantation. Rabies can be transmitted via slaughtering of infected reservoir species, for instance dogs in countries where dogs are consumed.
Rotavirus, a non-enveloped double-stranded RNA virus within the Reoviridae family, is classified into 7 rotavirus groups (A–G) as determined by the antigenic properties of the VP6 capsid protein. Group A is most common in human disease, with B and C to a lesser extent. Subgroups and serotypes are determined by seroand genotyping the epitopes P and G, of the VP4 and VP7 outer capsid proteins, respectively. These proteins are relevant for vaccine efficacy.
Early diagnosis and treatment; safe sexual practices (condom use). Proper bodily hygiene.
Consumption, white plague, TB.
Microscopy for eggs on stool samples by the Kato–Katz or rapid sedimentation techniques (RSTs) are diagnostic for the chronic infection. Serological tests (Fas2ELISA) is recommended for acute infection. The intradermal test is rapid and sensitive, but as it is not sufficiently specific it is no longer used. Radiology, such as computed tomography, can demonstrate liver lesions (only in acute infection) similar to metatastic lesions. For chronic infections, a cholangiogram can detect bile duct pathology caused by the adult parasites.
Hendra virus: manage contact between fruit bats and horse by basic husbandry measures such as placing food and water points under cover, regulate movement of horses from areas where the disease is occurring, regulate import of horses from Australia during outbreaks. Nipah virus: avoid contact with fruit bats and their discharges; wash and peel fruit, and wash hands before and after preparing fruit; regulate importation of pigs from outbreak areas.
Wildlife–tick–wildlife. The tick ingests infected blood of reservoir host, virus passes from gut to hemocoele to salivary glands and is transmitted to a new host at the next feed. The virus is transmitted from tick to tick trans-stadially and transovarially. Trans-stadial transmission is key to tickborne infections.
Humans
Junin virus is spread annually around harvest time by rodents to farmers. The range of Junin virus is extending to the north, putting an estimated 5 million people at risk. The other viruses are brought into villages and houses by peridomestic rodents, causing sporadic outbreaks with intervals of several years. Deforestation and human invasion into rodent habitat may have resulted in increased human exposure to infected rodents and a concomitant increase in human illnesses (see Forest Cover map). Only single cases of an infection by Sabia and Chapare viruses have been recorded. Pathogenicity of Whitewater Arroyo virus remains to be confirmed since there was no virus isolation from the Californian cases.
It is an occupational risk for those working in the environment in endemic regions (e.g. farmers, soldiers). Dust control where feasible (e.g. paving roads). Arthroconidia are resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can survive for many years in dust. Screening of organ donors for coccidioidomycosis in endemic areas. As the fungus is easily aerosolized it is a laboratory hazard.
Polioviral fever, infantile paralysis, acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), bulbar polio.
Argentinian (Junin virus), Bolivian (Machupo virus), Brazilian (Sabia virus), and Venezuelan (Guanarito virus) hemorrhagic fevers.
None.
Anthrax has a worldwide distribution. Livestock vaccination, antibiotic treatment, and quarantaine regulations lead to a strong decline in anthraxinfections in domestic lifestock. Anthrax occurs mainly in rural areas in countries where there is no livestock vaccination and no veterinary control of slaughtered animals.There is a seasonal variation in animal disease with an increase in cases during hot dry weather. Anthrax is an occupational hazard for people who process contaminated animal tissues. GI anthrax occurs when infected tissue is ingested. Of note is the terrorist distribution of anthrax powder by mail in the USA in 2001, which killed 5 people and produced sickness in 17.
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, an enveloped RNA virus with three subtypes: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, an enveloped
RVFV primarily causes disease in animals in Africa and Middle East, with human cases occurring during animal epidemics. Humans that regularly work with animals (farmers, herders, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers) are at increased risk of infection. Epidemics in animals occur when mosquito populations dramatically increase after periods of heavy rainfall or the production of wetlands behind man-made dams. RVF was initially confined to Sub-Saharan Africa, but appeared in Egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia and Yemen) in 2000 and later also on the Comoros Islands. As RVFV epidemics are closely associated with above-average rainfall, outbreaks can be forecasted upon which preventive measures can be implemented.
Taeniosis: detection of eggs in stool by microscopy; T. solium eggs can not be distinguished from T. saginata eggs; serology; Neurocysticercosis: histology; CT or MRI scan brain; serology is not sensitive or specific for neurocysticercosis.
90% of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic; 10% develop invasive-intestinal disease (colitis), and <1% extra-intestinal disease (liver abscess). Amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps, weight loss, and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea; most patients are afebrile. Amebic colitis rarely progresses to necrotizing colitis, ameboma, and toxic megacolon. Amebic colitis affects children and adults equally, but mainly males. Amebic liver-abscess mainly occurs in men aged 18 to 50 years, for unknown reasons. E. moshkovskii can cause non-invasive diarrhea.
Foxes (including urban foxes) are the definitive hosts, wild rodents (mainly Arvicolidae), voles and lemmings are intermediate hosts. Foxes have extended their distribution into urban areas, partly due to a decrease in rabies deaths in foxes since rabies vaccination.
The disease is self-limiting and acute symptoms are similar to acute hepatitis A disease. Children are generally asymptomatic or have mild disease. Clinical evident disease is more common in age group 15–44 years, with following symptoms: fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, and light stool. Pregnant women are at risk for severe disease, including fulminant hepatitis and death. In immunocompromised persons (e.g. transplant recipients or users of immune-modulating therapy) chronic infection has been reported.
LFV was isolated from a missionary nurse living in Lassa, Nigeria, in 1969. It is estimated there are 200,000 to 300,000 symptomatic Lassa fever cases in West Africa each year, with an associated mortality of 5,000 to 10,000. Lassa fever occurs in two geographically distinct regions: the Mano River region (Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia) in the West, and Nigeria in the East. In the dry season, the multi-mammate rat gathers in houses, and in the rainy season, the rat forages in the surrounding fields. Villages with Lassa fever are all located in rain forest areas or transition zones of rainforest to savannah, where the mean annual rainfall is above 1,500 mm and below 3,000 mm. LFV can be transmitted from rodents to humans both in the rainy and the dry season. However, in the dry season there may be an increased risk for humans due to aggregation of the rats in their houses.
Benznidazole, pentamidine, melarsoprol, eflornithine, suramin, and nifurtimox are effective in acute cases; melarprosol and eflornithine can have SAEs. Patients need to be followed up for 1–2 years.
Humans. Cattle and other livestock may harbor C. ulcerans
Sudden onset fever, frontal headache, backache, diarrhea and a rash; usually resolves without sequelae; fatalities are rare and the result of hemorrhage or meningoencephalitis. ILEV and NRIV can cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. CVV rarely causes encephalitis, with only one fatal case reported in the USA in 1995.
Hib is a common invasive bacterial infection that primarily causes pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia. Pneumonia due to Hib is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of bacterial pneumonia. Hib meningitis may present acutely or subacutely with fever, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and a bulging fontanelle in infants or a stiff neck in older children. Bacteremia may be present with meningitis or pneumonia but may also occur without an obvious focus of infection. Hib may also cause epiglottitis, which presents with fever, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing, talking and breathing. Infections of soft tissue, bones, and joints with H. influenzae may occur.
Self-limiting disease. Sudden onset of joint pain; fatigue, marked arthralgia and myalgia in more than 40%, stiff and swollen joints in 60–85% of cases; anorexia, headache, back pain, photophobia, sore throat, lethargy, and lymphadenopathy also occur, with fever and a maculopapular rash, usually on the trunk and limbs but also on palms and soles, in 50% of cases. Relapses occur; joint pains and swelling may relapse for as long as 6 years. Patients eventually recover completely.
Detection of toxin in serum, stool or wound by mouse inoculation or ELISA; culture of the bacterium from stool or wound; electromyography.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), North American tick typhus, New World spotted fever, Tick-borne or tick typhus, Tobia fever (Colombia), Sao Paulo fever or ‘febre maculosa’ (Brazil), and fiebre manchada (Mexico).
Supportive and antibiotics: oral doxycycline, ampicillin or amoxicillin for mild disease, parenteral penicillin G, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for severe disease.
Mainly a clinical diagnosis: subacute eosinophilic meningitis in an endemic area. Most common test is serology, but there are often false-positives due to cross-reactivity with other parasites. Worms are rarely seen in CSF by microscopy. MRI or CT scan of the brain is not diagnostic.
Serology (IFA,ELISA)or RT-PCR on bloodor CSF. Serology may cross-react with otherflaviviruses andlead to false-positives. Plaque Reduction Neutralization Tests (PRNT) and virus isolation are only done in specialized laboratories.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a non-enveloped singlestranded RNA virus, genus Hepevirus, the single member in the Hepeviridae family. The virus can be classified into four genotypes (genotype HEV-1 to HEV-4), and > 24 subgenotypes (1a–1e, 2a–2b, 3a–3j, and 4a–4g). Avian isolates of HEV are now considered to be a separate genus. HEV was discovered in the 1980s as a result of a large water-borne non-A non-B hepatitis outbreak in India between 1978 and 1979.
Mosquitoes, primarily Aedes and Ochlerotatus spp., secondarily Anopheles spp. Ae. triseriatus (eastern treehole mosquito) is the most important vector of LACV in the USA. LACV is abundant in forests with oak trees (basal holes are important breeding sites) and hickory hardwoods drained by rapid streams. Different species of cold-tolerant mosquitoes serve as vectors for JCV and SSHV.
Ancylostomiasis, Necatoriasis, Uncinariasis, ground itch.
Therapy is aimed at neutralizing the potent exotoxin, eradicating the organism, and providing supportive care. Immediate treatment with diphtheria antitoxin and iv antibiotics (penicillin or macrolide).
Supportive with pain management.
Lockjaw.
P. knowlesi transmission is restricted to the Leucosphyrus group of anophelines, consisting of 20 species.
Personal anti-mosquito precautions; vector control; screening blood and transplant products. There is no vaccine approved for human use. There are several veterinary vaccines.
Polyarthritis and rash, epidemic polyarthritis, Barmah Forest virus disease, and Ross River virus disease, Murweh virus disease.
Invasive disease: tinidazole or metronidazole. For severe amebic colitis antibiotics are added to prevent and treat bacterial peritonitis. Surgery for intra-abdominal complications (e.g. bleeding, perforation). Aspiration for liver abscesses. Intraluminal parasites and asymptomatic infection are treated with paromomycin.
Humans and possibly cats.
Trench fever, quintana fever, quintan fever, shinbone fever, shank fever, His-Werner disease, and Wolhynia fever.
Microscopy, isolation of the agent from lesion, blood or pus by inoculation into mouse footpad or guinea pigs, or culture; serum agglutination test; PCR.
Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, Venezuelan equine fever, Mucambo virus fever.
Thorough cleansing of wounds and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP): rabies-immune globulin and a series of rabies vaccinations. Vaccination of people at high risk (veterinarians, animal rescue personnel, laboratory staff, etc.), avoid contact with stray dogs or cats, sick or dead wildlife; vaccinate all dogs and cats; distribute baits containing oral vaccine in wildlife habitat; quarantine dogs arriving from infected countries. Culling of stray dogs is ineffective; sterilization prevents replacement breeding.
Echinococcus multilocularis, a small (3–6 mm long) cyclophyllid cestode (tapeworm).
Ziehl–Neelsen stain on smears or biopsies, culture (takes 6–12 weeks), PCR, histopathology.
Histoplasmosis may be divided into the following four types: (1) pulmonary histoplasmosis, (2) disseminated histoplasmosis, (3) cutaneous histoplasmosis, and (4) African histoplasmosis. Most infections are asymptomatic or mild and resolve without treatment. The acute phase begins with fever, malaise, chest pains and a dry cough. Chest X-ray findings are normal in 40–70% of cases. Severe infections result in mediastinitis, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and adrenal enlargement. Osteomyelitis is rare. Disseminated disease occurs in patients with altered cellular immunity such as individuals with AIDS and those receiving immunosuppressive medications. It presents with systemic complaints and multiple organ involvement: lung, spleen, bone marrow, adrenals, CNS and GI tract being the most affected. Disseminated histoplasmosis is fatal unless treated. Past infection results in partial protection. Reactivation is uncommon but may occur.
Plasmodium ovale, an intacellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa. Phylogenetically, P. ovale clusters with other Plasmodium species affecting simian primates.
Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and B. timori, threadlike nematode worms 80 to 100 mm long (W. bancrofti), or 43 to 55 mm long (B. malayi).
By mosquito bite. There is no person-toperson transmission.
Rubella virus, a single-stranded RNA positive-sense rubivirus of the family Togaviridae.
Approximately 1 million people are infected with Schistosoma spp. in Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, and the Philippines. Schistosomiasis has been eliminated from Japan and the burden has been greatly reduced in China through extensive control efforts. Schistosomiasis is a water-based disease, that mainly affects rural agricultural and fishing communities. Higher disease prevalence rates in endemic regions are found close to large irrigation projects or dams. S. japonicum is found in China, Philippines, and Indonesia. In Indonesia, schistosomiasis is confined to two endemic areas in Central Sulawesi. S. mekongi is found in the Mekong River area of Cambodia and Laos, and has also been detected in Thailand. S. malayensis has only been reported from Malaysia and is a rare cause of human disease.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Non-human primates in Africa and humansin Asia; Asianmonkeys can be infected, but do not seem to constitute an important reservoir. During intra-epidemic periods, several vertebrates have been implicated as potential reservoirs.
Unknown.
Supportive.
Fibrous subcutaneous nodules in the head and shoulders (Americas), pelvic girdle and legs (Africa), a pruritic rash, disfiguring skin lesions (chronic papular and lichenified onchodermatitis), skin depigmentation (leopard skin), edema and skin atrophy, inflammatory process in the cornea leading to irreversible blindness, growth arrest, and epilepsy. The proportion of depigmentation and blindness is most common in older ( > 40 years) age groups. The disease may lead to excess mortality.
Most commonly, the urban container-breeding, daybitingmosquitoesAedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus; in Polynesia, Ae. scutellaris complex spp.; in Malaysia, Ae. nivaeus complex spp., in West Africa, Ae. furcifer-taylori complex spp., and recently in Europe by Ae. albopictus (see Aedes map).
Detection of viral RNA in blood by RTPCR; serology (IgM ELISA); virus culture.
Large trematode liver flukes living in blile ducts: Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. F. hepatica is 20 to 30 mm long and F. gigantica can be up to 75 mm long.
Ebola viruses (genus Ebolavirus), marburg viruses (genus Marburgvirus), and ‘cueva viruses’, family Filoviridae, order Mononegavirales; enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses. There are five ebola viruses: Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Ebola virus (EBOV), Reston virus (RESTV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Taï Forest virus (TAFV); two marburg viruses: Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV); and one ‘cuevavirus’: Lloviu virus (LLOV).
The highest global burden of CL is in the Old World. In the Americas, Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru have the highest burden of CL. In the New World, CL mainly occurs in forested areas, whereas in the Old World it is associated with semi-arid and desert regions. Transmision can also occur in deforested areas. Disease mainly occurs in those living or working in the forests of endemic areas. Outbreaks can occur during military training in the jungle or infrastructural projetcs in endemic areas. Also, travelers acquire the disease during visits to rural or jungle regions. Disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. Clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is probably related to the short flight range of sandflies.
Descending flaccid skeletal muscle paralysis beginning at the shoulders in the absence of fever; fatigue, weakness, vertigo, blurred vision, dry mouth, difficulty in speaking and swallowing, progressing to an inability to breathe without assistance. Vomiting, diarrhea or constipation may occur. The CFR in the USA after treatment is 5–10%; recovery may take months. Infants present with constipation, anorexia, weakness, an altered cry, difficulty sucking, and swallowing. Muscle weakness progresses in a symmetric descending fashion over hours to a few days. The prognosis is excellent when treated timely.
F. tularensis tularensis Type A is found in North America and the distribution is associatedwith wild rabbits, ticks, and tabanid flies. Type B is found throughout the northern hemisphere, mainly in Eurasia and is associated with multiple rodent species, hares, ticks, blood-feeding mosquitoes, and tabanid flies. There is also an association with water bodies (streams) and flooding. In the USA, around 200 human tularemia cases are reported each year, mostly in rural areas during summer months. In Europe, most cases are reported from Sweden, Finland, and Russia, and is recently emerging in Spain. Rural populations are most at risk (e.g. farmers, hunters). Human outbreaks often coincide with wild animal outbreaks.
Gastric anisakidosis: findings depend on where in the gastrointestinal tract the ingested larvae embed. Gastric anisakidosis is the predominant form with acute severe gastric pain, nausea, and vomiting and sometimes hematemesis. Intestinal anisakiasis can cause abdominal pain, obstruction, peritonitis, ulceration, and bleeding. Anisakis-associated hypersensitivity is increasingly being reported and varies from acute urticaria to anaphylaxis. Pharyngeal anisakiasis is rare with pharyngeal irritation as the main symptom.
Rarely reported in the Americas and Europe, sporadic in parts of Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, China, and Vietnam. Most important risk factor is contact with pigs or uncooked pig products, typically by farmers, veterinary personnel, abattoir workers, and butchers. Furthermore, in several Asian countries it is common to consume uncooked pork products, like blood, which is a risk for acquiring the disease. Individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those who have been splenectomized, are also at increased risk. Since S. suis is often misidentified, S. suis may be more common in certain parts of the world with high pig densities.
Malaria requires urgent treatment and type of treatment depends on disease severity and drug resistance in the region. Artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in the Thai–Cambodian border region. Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria: artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs); the choice of ACTs is based on the resistance levels of the partner medicine in the combination. Artemisinin and its derivatives should not be used as monotherapy. Severe malaria: artesunate iv or im; complete treatment with an ACT or artesunate plus doxycycline or clindamycin.
Main transmission is fecal–oral, but houseflies act as supplementary vectors by contaminating food after feeding on exposed human feces.
Direct transmission via skin to skin or oral contact (also via sharing drinking and eating utensils). Sharing of drinking vessels plays an important role in transmission of endemic syphilis in arid regions. There is little or no mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy.
Dry, sandy alkaline soil in the semi-arid zones of the USA–Mexico border and parts of Central and South America. In North America, the fungus is mainly found in the Lower Sonoran Life Zone with low rainfall and high temperatures C. immitis is present in California, and probably northern Mexico and Arizona, and C. posadasii is present in the remaining areas.
Unclear, but likely through inhalation of P. marneffei conidia from the environment; cutaneous inoculation may also occur. There is no human-to-human transmission.
By tsetse fly bite (day biters); blood transfusion, and congenital.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Q fever has been described world wide, with the exception of New Zealand. Though small outbreaks are reported from tropical countries, serological studies do show that the prevalence of disease is higher there than in temperate regions. Most human outbreaks involve either goats or sheep. The largest global outbreak ever reported occurred in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2010, mainly in the southeast where there is a high density of dairy goat farms. The outbreak led to a high incidence of infections in people exposed to aerosols living in the vicinity of infected farms but had no occupational exposure. People living within 2 km of a farm had a much higher risk than those living > 5km away. The hospitalization rate was relatively high, 20% versus around 5% which is normally reported.
