ONNV is a mutant of CHIKV that appeared in 1959 in Uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of Africa , leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic . There was a small outbreak in Côte d'Ivoire in 1984 -- 1985 and again in 2003 , also described as Igbo-Ora virus and a small recurrence in Uganda in 1996 . Serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in Kenya in 1994 -- 1995 and in horses in Nigeria , but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with CHIKV antibody .

During bloodmeal , the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes . In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes .
During bloodmeal , the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes . The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding .

Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide , mainly during the rainy season . Sporadic human infections with glanders -LRB- B. mallei -RRB- , occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists , horse butchers , and laboratory workers .
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown . Cases have been reported in dryer areas , like northeastern Brazil and north Iran . This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields . In Southeast Asia , it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water .

Junin virus is spread annually around harvest time by rodents to farmers . The range of Junin virus is extending to the north , putting an estimated 5 million people at risk . The other viruses are brought into villages and houses by peridomestic rodents , causing sporadic outbreaks with intervals of several years . Pathogenicity of Whitewater Arroyo virus remains to be confirmed since there was no virus isolation from the Californian cases .
