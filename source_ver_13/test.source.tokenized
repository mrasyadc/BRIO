By tick bite ; larval ticks are carried on migrating birds , which are refractory to the virus . The virus is also spread among veterinarians , farmers , shepherds , butchers , and slaughter-house workers by contact with the blood of infected livestock . Person-to-person spread is by contact with infectious body fluids of patients .
Acute : hepatomegaly , prolonged fever , anorexia , weight loss , nausea , vomiting , cough , diarrhea , urticaria , lymphadenopathies , and arthralgias . Significant clinical improvement 3 -- 5 days after specific treatment is diagnostic . Chronic -LRB- which may be asymptomatic and last for more than 10 years -RRB- : biliary obstruction with upper abdominal pain , cholecystitis , cholangitis , and extrahepatic cholestasis . Liver fibrosis may be a complication of the infection .
Piscivorous -LRB- fish-eating -RRB- mammals , including : humans , dogs , cats , pigs , rats , and several species of wild animals . Humans can remain infected for several decades .
Herbivores become infected when they ingest spores during grazing on contaminated soil . When the animal dies , the soil under the carcase is contaminated . Omnivores and carnivores are infected by feeding on infected prey or carcases . Carnivores and humans are incidental hosts .
Mainly Ochlerotatus vigilax and Culex annulirostris . Aedes camptorhynchus , A. normanensis , A. notoscriptus , and Coquillettidia linealis are vectors in some circumstances .
Colorado tick fever is only present in North America -LRB- USA and Canada -RRB- . In the USA , besides the states with human cases shown on the map , the virus has been isolated from ticks within the range of D. andersoni . The typical habitat of the tick and its rodent hosts is a south-facing slope above 1,500 meters with Ponderosa pine and shrubs on dry , rocky surfaces . Infection is seasonal , coinciding with the period of greatest tick activity in early summer . Human cases can be detected from March to September in the Rocky Mountain region , USA . Most human cases are males , aged 20 -- 29 years , probably reflecting the frequency of outdoor activity in the mountains .
Through inhalation of aerosolized microconidia from disturbed soil or guano . Also by inoculation and organ transplantation .
Fecal -- oral route , mainly via fecally contaminated water , but also via : food , materno-fetal , and transfusion of blood products . Direct person-to-person transmission is uncommon . Cycle : Human to human and occasionally animal to human . HEV is excreted from the liver into the stool via the bile and eventually into the environment . The amount of infectious virus in the stool is relatively low and explains a lower rate of transmission as compared to hepatitis A -LRB- see Hepatitis A map -RRB- .
Avoid contamination of skin by potentially infected soil or water . There is no vaccine available .
It is endemic in tropical and subtropical climates , such as Papua New Guinea , South Africa , parts of India and Indonesia , and among the aborigines of Australia . Some cases have been reported in the countries of Central and South America and the Caribbean . The disease may be related more to socioeconomic conditions than to racial or geographical factors . In some settings it is a common cause of chronic genital ulcers in HIV patients . In the USA , it is more common in African-Americans , of people in lower socioeconomic status , and those with poor hygiene . It has been hypothesized that the natural habitat of K. granulomatis is the intestine and that the skin is affected by direct contact during anal coitus , or indirectly through contamination of the genitals by fecal material . There is no gender difference in incidence ; most cases occur in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years . There are no reports of congenital infections , but cases have been reported in newborn and nursing babies ; the course of the disease is more aggressive during gestation . Donovanosis increases the risk of subsequent HIV infection .
Personal anti-mosquito precautions . Adulticide spraying is practiced in areas where horse cases appear . A human vaccine against only the North American strain is available for laboratory personnel .
Rodents , principally rats and sylvatic ground squirrels : marmots , susliks , and prairie dogs . Rabbits , camels , carnivores , and domestic cats may also be infected . Cats can also develop pneumonic plague . The desert regions of Central Asia contain endemic plague foci where the great gerbil is the main host .
Tick to mammalian host to tick for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma ; trematode to aquatic host to trematode for Neorickettsia . Human is a dead-end host for all . During the eclipse phase of both HME and HGA infection , the blood remains potentially infectious by blood transfusion .
Standard louse control and personal tick protection . Chemoprophylaxis may be used for bite victims .
Microscopic examination of sputum for eggs -LRB- acid-fast staining destroys eggs -RRB- , and examination of feces after using concentration techniques ; ELISA for serology .
Ingested E. histolytica non-motile cysts will excyst in the gastrointestinal tract and develop to motile trophozoites that can penetrate the gut mucosa . In the colon , the trophozoites encyst and the cysts are excreted with the feces .
The distribution of RMSF and R. parkeri rickettsiosis is limited by the tick vector distribution . Average annual RMSF incidence of the disease in the USA was 2.2 cases per million between 1997 and 2002 , and approximately 250 -- 1,200 cases are reported each year . Many cases of RMSF may actually have been caused by other rickettsial agents , as was seen with R. parkeri . Many rickettsiae of unknown pathogenicity are present in ticks and new disease causing agents are still being discovered . RMSF in the USA follows a seasonal pattern with most cases in warmer months , when ticks are most active . RMSF cases are usually found in rural areas , and less commonly in urban areas . Residing in wooded regions or areas with high grass and exposure to dogs increases the risk of RMSF . RMSF is sporadic and rarely occurs in clusters .
Snail -- human -- snail . Infected humans shed eggs into the water , which hatch into larvae -LRB- miracidia -RRB- that enter snails and develop into motile larvae -LRB- cercariae -RRB- . The cercariae are shed into the water and penetrate the skin of humans in the water , enter the bloodstream and settle in the liver . When matured to adult male and female worms , they migrate to the abdominal veins -LRB- S. mansoni , S. intercalatum , S. guineensis -RRB- or pelvic veins -LRB- S. haematobium -RRB- , mate and produce eggs . Snails remain infectious for up to 3 months , humans for more than 10 years .

Humans .
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa , where it is estimated that 12 -- 13 million humans are infected . The prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age , and is more common in men as they are more exposed . Loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control . It has been proposed that areas where the Loiasis prevalence is > 20 % , are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment .
Reducing sexual transmission through the promotion ofmonogamy , condom use , male circumcision , and the detection and treatment of STIs ; raising awareness of individual HIV status through voluntary counseling and testing ; protecting IVDUs through needle/syringe exchange and methadone replacement programs ; reducing mother to child transmission through voluntary counseling and testing and the provision of ARVs .
Doxycycline for all patients . Rifampicin may be useful for HGA in younger children and pregnant patients .
Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne diseasein both North America and Europe , where its incidence is increasing . Incidence is seasonal , corresponding to increased vector activity during summer . The three Borrelia species differ in geographic location , vectors , and clinical manifestations : B. burgdorferi ss is present both in North America and Europe , but is absent from Asia ; B. garinii andB . afzelii occur in Europe and Asia . A recent study showed that B. garinii is the main genotype in China . Data of B. burgdorferi presence are lacking for South America , Sub-Saharan Africa , South and Southeast Asia . In the USA the disease is focal : most cases come from limited areas in the northeastern and upper midwestern regions . In the Baltic region , disease rates are several fold higher than in the USA . Incidences vary , ranging from 0.3 / 100,000 in the UK to 130/100 ,000 in Austria . Climate change , more housing in wooded areas , and expanding populations of deer , and small rodents may be responsible for the increase in Lyme disease cases . None of the mammal species identified as reservoir hosts and none of the transmitting ticks are present in Australia .

Breakbone fever .
For C. philippinensis : eggs are passed in the stools of humans and fish-eating birds ; after ingestion by freshwater fish , larvae hatch , penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the tissues . Ingestion of raw or undercooked fish results in infection of the human and bird host . The adults of C. philippinensis reside in the mucosa of the human small intestine , where the females lay eggs . Released larvae can cause autoinfection , which may progress to hyperinfection .
Serology -LRB- IgM ELISA , IFA -RRB- ; RT-PCR . Virus isolation is difficult .
Hepatitis C virus -LRB- HCV -RRB- is an enveloped RNA virus -LRB- hepacavirus -RRB- and belongs to theflaviviruses . The HCV genome is highly mutable . There are at least six HCV genotypes and several subtypes with differences in clinical presentation , geographic distribution and treatment response . HCV was discovered in 1989 as another cause of transfusion associated hepatitis -LRB- non-A non-B hepatitis -RRB- .
There is a vaccine against Junin virus only . Targeted rodent control in houses , except for Junin virus , which is spread by rodents in the fields . Barrier nursing of cases .
C. burnetii is resistant to many disinfectants and extreme environmental conditions . The organism can survive in aerosols for 2 weeks and in soil up to 5 months . Prevention is targeted to those working with livestock , mainly sheep and goats ; appropriate disposal of birth products ; routine testing of risk animals ; restricted movement of animals in infected regions ; culling of infected animals ; a human and veterinary vaccine is available in several countries ; pasteurize milk .
There are three transmission cycles : -LRB- 1 -RRB- sylvatic or jungle , -LRB- 2 -RRB- intermediate or savannah , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- urban . All three cycles exist in Africa and the sylvatic and urban yellow fever occur in South America . The sylvatic cycle happens in tropical rainforests where monkeys are infected by mosquitoes , and pass the virus onto other mosquitoes that feed on them ; sporadically humans can become infected when entering the forest for work . The intermediate cycle is present in the savannahs of Africa , resulting in small oubreaks in rural settlements . Urban yellow fever can lead to large outbreaks in humans when infected individualsintroduce the virus to the urban mosquito population -LRB- mainly Aedes aegypti -RRB- , that subsequently can transmit to other humans .
Virus isolation from stool , CSF or oropharyngeal secretion , followed by typing -LRB- to determine if the virus is ` wild type ' or a vaccine strain -RRB- . Alternatively , the diagnosis can be established by serological testing .
Hepatitis B is a common disease world wide , despite the existence of a vaccine . The WHO estimates that globally 2 billion individuals have been infected , of which about 360 million have chronic disease . Yearly , it is estimated that there are 500,000 to 700,000 HBV associated deaths world wide . In high-endemic regions like Southeast Asia , Africa , and the Amazon basin , most individuals become infected during childhood -LRB- mother-to-child , or child-to-child -RRB- . In developed regions , the prevalence is low and important routes of transmission are different , consisting mostly of unsafe sexual practices , IVDU , and occupational transmission in healthcare workers . Chronic HBV associated liver cirrhosis is more common in developed nations than in Southeast Asia , but the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is lower compared to Southeast Asia . It is not yet fully clear whether this is due to differences in HBV genotype or age of infection .
Whitmore disease .
Tick bite prevention by avoiding wooded and bushy areas with high grass and leaf litter , especially in summer months ; insect repellents ; minimize bare skin check for tick bites and remove them within 24 hours .
Hantaviruses , a large group of different , enveloped , single-stranded , negative-sense viruses with a tripartite RNA genome , that belong to the Bunyaviridae family . Hantaviruses are named after the Hantan River area in South Korea , where the first hantavirus -LRB- Hantaan -RRB- was isolated in the 1970s . Old World and New World hantaviruses share high similarity in their genome and have comparable life cycles . Currently , there is no consensus on the classification of hantaviruses . Old World hantaviruses shown on the map are : Dobrava -- Belgrade virus -LRB- DOBV -RRB- , Hantaan virus -LRB- HTNV -RRB- , Puumula virus -LRB- PUUV -RRB- , and Saaremaa virus -LRB- SAAV -RRB- . Seoul virus -LRB- SEOV -RRB- is not shown , it is world wide in major port cities .

Through contamination of penetrating wounds -LRB- e.g. by thorns , splinters -RRB- . There is no person-to-person transmission .
This is unknown at present . M. ulcerans has been found in biofilms on vegetation in swamps and other permanent wetlands , aquatic insects , snails , and fish . In Australia , some land animals , particularly native possums , have been found to carry M. ulcerans in their gastrointestinal tracts .
SARS is thought to have emerged in Guangdong Province , China , in November 2002 and within 6 months cases were detected in 26 countries , with local transmission occurring in 6 . In total over 8,000 cases and almost 800 deaths were recorded and , remarkably , much of the global transmission of SARS can be traced to a single individual who disseminated infection at a hotel in Hong Kong . ` Super spreading ' events -LRB- where one person infects an unusually large number of people -RRB- , such as occurred at the Hong Kong Hotel , appear to be an important feature of SARS epidemiology . The precise circumstances and timing of the interspecies transfer of SARS-CoV remains unknown . Many of the early cases in Guangdong had epidemiological links to the wild animal trade but later the transmission of SARS was exclusively person-to-person with a large nosocomial element . Laboratory-accident associated cases in late 2003 and April 2004 , and a cluster linked to the wild animal trade in January 2004 , highlight the potential for the re-emergence of SARS .
ONNV is a mutant of CHIKV that appeared in 1959 in Uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of Africa , leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic . This large epidemic was remarkable because , in spite of the occurrence of millions of cases , no deaths were reported . It ended without a trace in 1962 , reappearing as sporadic cases in Africa at rare intervals . In Nigeria in 1966 and 1969 , cases were described as a new virus , IgboOra , later recognized as ONNV . There was a small outbreak in Côte d'Ivoire in 1984 -- 1985 and again in 2003 , also described as Igbo-Ora virus and a small recurrence in Uganda in 1996 . Serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in Kenya in 1994 -- 1995 and in horses in Nigeria , but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with CHIKV antibody . It is not known how or where the virus survives between outbreaks , but sequence data show very little variation between ONNV strains isolated in Uganda in 1959 and 1996 -- 1997 , suggesting that the virus persists , rather than undergoing repeated mutations from CHIKV -LRB- which has a non-human primate reservoir -RRB- .
Gram stain and microscopy of cerebrospinal fluid , and culture . Latex agglutination tests for detection of group-specific capsular polysaccharide . PCR .
Oral rehydration therapy -LRB- ORT -RRB- using reduced osmolarity ORS ; intravenous rehydration in severe cases . Antibiotics are only useful to prevent spread , as they do not affect the already released toxin .

Vector control ; mosquito repellent ; insecticidetreated bed nets ; treatment of infected humans .
Crustaceans infected with metacercaria larvae are ingested by the reservoir host , excyst in the gut and migrate to the tissues , usually the lungs . There they encapsulate , mature , and lay eggs . Eggs enter the sputum which is coughed up and swallowed , then pass out in the feces into water and hatch in 2 -- 4 weeks into miracidia larvae . These penetrate the body of the vector snail , where they develop in about 2 months into cercaria larvae which enter and encyst in freshwater crabs and crayfish .
Ova are excreted with the feces of infected animals , and develop into larvae which are ingested by squid and other invertebrates -- these in turn are ingested by fish which may be eaten raw by humans . Humans are accidental hosts .
Mainly humans ; rarely non-human primates and other mammals .

The differential diagnosis is chloroquine-resistant malaria , Lyme disease , or human granulocytic anaplasmosis .
Isolation of agent from blood , urine , sputum , pus or skin lesions ; direct immunofluorescence ; serology . PCR may be of value on samples other than blood .
It is estimated that 17 million people are infected world wide and 91 million are at risk of infection . F. hepatica is endemic on all continents but is of particular public health importance in the Andean countries -LRB- especially Peru and Bolivia -RRB- , Ecuador , Chile , Argentina , Brazil , Venezuela , Cuba , Mexico , the Islamic Republic of Iran , Egypt , Philippines , and western Europe -LRB- e.g. France , Portugal , and Spain -RRB- . Infections with F. gigantica are restricted to Africa and Asia . Both species of fluke overlap in many areas of Africa and Asia , whereas F. hepatica is the major concern in the Americas , Europe , and Oceania . The rural areas of the Andean region of Peru and Bolivia have prevalence rates of up to 68 % . Women are affected more than men , with higher prevalence rates , more severe infections , and more reported liver or biliary complications ; children are affected more than adults . The main source of infection is the consumption of raw vegetables contaminated with metacercariae , such as watercress , salads , and contaminated water from irrigation channels . Pharyngeal fascioliasis may occur after ingestion of raw goat or sheep liver -- a dish in some Middle Eastern countries .
Hendra virus : through contact with infectious body fluids , including urine , saliva , and nasal discharge , or during autopsy of infected horses . Nipah virus : through contact with infectious body fluids , including bat saliva -LRB- on fallen fruit and in date palm sap -RRB- , or droplets from coughing infected pigs .

The only real reservoir is the tick . Viremia persists only for a few days in transmission competent vertebrates , rodents -LRB- mainly Apodemus spp . -RRB- . Deer , birds , possibly marmots are not competent to transmit to ticks .
Inhalation of spores from disturbed soil . There is no person-to-person transmission .
None
PCR on blood or skin biopsy , or IFA on the latter . Serology is unspecific due to cross-reactivity .
HBV disease has an acute and chronic form . 10 % of children and 30 -- 50 % of adults present with symptoms of acute HBV infection similar to hepatitis A and last several weeks : fatigue , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , myalgia , jaundice , dark urine , and light stools . Fever is often absent and arthritis and rash may be present . Chronic disease evolves to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma and eventually death . 90 % of infants who are infected in their first year develop chronic infection . Only 10 % of adults who acquire infection develop chronic disease , as the majority is able to clear HBV within 6 months . Differences in disease severity , risk of liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma are seen by age of infection , level of viral replication , level of inflammation , region and HBV genotype . Also co-infection with HDV leads to more severe chronic liver disease .
Rodent -- rodent , with humans as accidental dead-end hosts . Infected reservoir hosts are asymptomatic and excrete infectious virus in the urine .
In 2000 it was estimated there were approximately 21,650,000 new S. Typhi cases and 216,500 deaths , with large regional variability . These estimates are based on limited data from mainly countries with a high incidence of disease . Typhoid fever incidence is highest among infants and children living in South Central and Southeast Asia and South Africa . Two seasonality patterns are observed : -LRB- 1 -RRB- higher incidence in warmer dry months leading to higher bacterial loads in the water , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- higher incidence in the rainy season , due to spillover from sewage to drinking water . Declines are seen in regions were living conditions have improved , mainly due to access to clean water and sanitation -LRB- see Water and Sanitation map -RRB- .
An inactivated virus vaccine -LRB- not licenced -RRB- is limited available to protect laboratory workers , veterinarians and others ` at risk .

Consumption of raw , undercooked , dried , salted , or pickled freshwater fish . There is no direct person-to-person transmission .
Clean wounds , perform debridement and remove foreign objects . A one-off dose of im or iv human tetanus immunoglobulin removes unbound toxin but does not affect bound toxin . Metronidazole in large doses for 7 -- 14 days to eradicate C. tetani infection . Since the effect of bound toxin may last for 4 -- 6 weeks , prolonged supportive care is required . Tetanus does not induce immunity . Vaccination with tetanus toxoid is therefore indicated during treatment .
Humans . Asymptomatic carriage of N.meningitidis in the oropharynx is common , although carriage rates vary widely by geographic and epidemiological setting . The carrier state is immunizing and development of meningococcal disease is associated with recent acquisition .
Principally wild birds in North America . Wild rodents , bats , reptiles , or amphibians may also be involved . Pheasants may serve as sentinels as they develop fatal disease . Chickens are more typically used as sentinels by detection of seroconversion .
Western equine encephalitis virus -LRB- WEEV -RRB- , an enveloped , spherical , single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus , genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae . WEEV is believed to have descended from an ancestral recombinant derived from eastern equine encephalitis virus and Sindbis virus .

Vivax malaria is the second most important malaria species after P. falciparum and accounts for 25 -- 40 % of the cases world wide with 132 -- 391 million cases per year . Outside Africa it is the dominant species , mainly in Asia . The distribution is wider than P. falciparum as it is able to develop at lower temperatures and can form hypnozoites in human liver . The high prevalence of Duffy negativity in western Africa has influenced the epidemiology of P. vivax , as Duffy-negative people are apparently resistant to vivax malaria , although several reports suggest that Duffy-negative people can be infected with P.vivax . The disease burden is greatest in infants . In 2010 , an autochtonous P.vivax case was diagnosed in north eastern Spain . Malaria was declared eradicated from Spain in 1964 . P.vivax may have been transmitted by the local vector Anopheles atroparvus , which can transmit Asiatic P. vivax strains .

Avoid accumulations of bird or bat droppings such as are found in caves . The USA government provides a document , ` Histoplasmosis : Protecting Workers at Risk ' , with information on work practices and personal protective equipment .
The sandfly Lutzomyia verrucarum . Preferred habitat : narrow river gorges at elevations between 500 and 3,200 meters .
Environment -LRB- soil -RRB- to human . Fungal spores are inhaled and convert to the pathogenic yeast form in the lung from where they can disseminate to other organs .
Personal anti-mosquito precautions ; there is no vaccine for WEE .
Small wild mammals such as rodents , snowshoe hares , deer and vector mosquitoes -LRB- venereal and transovarian transmission occur -RRB- . Dayfeeding chipmunks and squirrels are the principal amplifying hosts of LACV , as the main vector -LRB- Aedes triseriatus -RRB- only bites in daytime . For this reason , nightfeeding small mammals are rarely infected with LACV . The white-tailed deer is the main amplifying host for JCV -LRB- horses can also be an amplifying host -RRB- . Snowshoe hares and the arctic ground squirrel are the amplifying hosts of SSHV .
Humans are viremic at a titer high enough to infect mosquitoes for up to 5 days after infection . The virus travels from the mosquito gut to the salivary glands in 5 -- 7 days , depending on the ambient temperature -LRB- extrinsic incubation period -RRB- , after which it can infect another human during feeding .
None .
Mosquitoes , principally canopy-dwelling Haemagogus and Sabethes spp . The virus has also been isolated from Psorophora , Mansonia and Culex spp .
Treatment of uncomplicated B. quintana bacteremia is with a macrolide -LRB- erythromycin , azithromycin -RRB- or doxycyclin . In case of endocarditis 4 -- 6 months of therapy is recommended in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin or gentamicin for the first 2 -- 3 weeks . Heart valve replacement may be needed .
About 60 % of exposures result in asymptomatic infection . Symptoms range from benign pulmonary infection -LRB- fever , chills , cough , chest pain , dyspnea -RRB- , night sweats , anorexia and weight loss to progressive pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease involving skin , bones and/or joints , the central nervous system , and other organ systems . Most patients with primary disease recover spontaneously and have life-long immunity to re-infection . Chronic and disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to 5 % of cases . Meningeal infection occurs in less than 1 % of extrapulmonary cases and requires life-long treatment .
Probably non-human primates ; the virus has been isolated from monkeys in Panama and French Guiana , also in the USA from a north-bound migratory bird . Antibody has been found in domestic animals and other vertebrates .
Not completely understood ; most Bunyamwera viruses are likely maintained in nature involving a transmission cycle with various small mammals -LRB- mainly wild rodents -RRB- as amplifying hosts and mosquitoes . African rodents replicate BUNV and develop viremia . Livestock -LRB- goats , sheep , cattle -RRB- , horses and rodents are hosts for GERV as shown by seroprevalence studies . Amplifying hosts for CVV are mainly large mammals -LRB- caribou , deer , horses , sheep -RRB- .
Contact with infected animal tissue . Cutaneous anthrax : direct skin inoculation during processing of contaminated animal hides , hair , wool , or animal hide products . Gastro-intestinal -LRB- GI -RRB- anthrax : Contact with infected animal tissue . Cutaneous anthrax : direct skin inoculation during processing of contaminated animal hides , hair , wool , or animal hide products .
In 1988 , the WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative -LRB- GPEI -RRB- . The Americas were certified polio-free in 1994 , the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and Europe in 2002 -LRB- in 2010 , there was importation of polio into Europe -RRB- . The GPEI has four main strategies to stop transmission of the wild poliovirus : -LRB- 1 -RRB- high infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral poliovirus vaccine -LRB- OPV -RRB- in the first year of life ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- supplementary doses of OPV to all children under 5 years of age during SIAs ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- surveillance for wild poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all acute flaccid paralysis -LRB- AFP -RRB- cases among children under 15 years of age ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- targeted campaigns once wild poliovirus transmission is limited to a specific focal area . To be certified polio-free , three conditions must be met : -LRB- 1 -RRB- there are at least 3 years of zero polio cases due to wild poliovirus ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- disease surveillance efforts in countries meet international standards ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- each country must illustrate the capacity to detect , report , and respond to ` imported ' polio cases . Oral live attenuated polio vaccines can give rise to circulation of vaccinederived polioviruses and rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis . For this reason , efforts are underway to develop affordable options for inactivated polio vaccination .
By tick bites , except for N. sennetsu , which is probably transmitted through ingestion of uncooked , parasitized aquatic hosts . No person-to-person spread except by blood transfusion .
As mosquito vectors and wildlife reservoirs are widespread , control is not feasible ; personal anti-mosquito measures ; eliminating potential breeding sites -LRB- e.g. old tires -RRB- and filling of basal tree-holes with concrete .
Smallpox vaccine is protective , but not a feasible solution in the remote forest habitat where monkeypox is endemic . Hospital personnel should isolate patients and take infection control precautions .
Microscopy of respiratory secretions , pleural fluid , tissue or exudate in which detection of spherules containing endospores is diagnostic -LRB- double-walled structures , size 20 -- 100 mm -RRB- fungal culture of sputum , blood , pus , and urine ; coccidioidal serologic tests ; cocciodin or spherulin skin test -LRB- not available in USA -RRB- . Serology on CSF to diagnose meningitis .
Eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies , mature in about 2 to 3 weeks , depending on water temperature , and hatch ciliated larvae -LRB- coracidia -RRB- . Coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans -LRB- copepods -RRB- . The copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host , typically small fish . The larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae . Larger predator fish -LRB- e.g. pike , burbot , perch -RRB- ingest the smaller infected fish upon which the plerocercoid larvae migrate to the flesh of these larger fish that serve as third intermediate hosts harboring larvae . Humans and larger mammals acquire the disease by eating these larger fish raw or undercooked . The larvae mature into adult tapeworms that attach to the small intestinal wall by scolex and develop eggfilled proglottids that detach . Up to 1 million eggs per day per worm are passed in the feces , 2 -- 6 weeks after infection .
By airborne droplets from or contact with nose and throat secretions of infected persons , very high from 4 days before to 4 days after rash appears , or with fomites contaminated with those secretions . Droplets remain infectious for several hours , longer under conditions of low humidity . Measles virus is highly contagious .
A generally mild and short-lived illness with fever , coryza , conjunctivitis , lymphadenopathy , and a fine maculopapular rash beginning on the face later spreading to the trunks and limbs . Postauricular , occipital or posterior cervical lymphadenopathy may precede the rash by 5 -- 10 days . Around half of rubella infections are subclinical and constitutional symptoms may be minimal in children . Arthropathy may occur , especially in young women . The most important clinical consequence of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome -LRB- CRS -RRB- , which may result from intra-uterine infection in thefirst 16 weeks of pregnancy . CRS is a severe disease characterized by deafness , cataract , cardiac abnormalities , and a range of neurological impairments .
Clostridium tetani , a Gram-positive , spore-forming anaerobic bacterium . The spores can remain viable in the environment for years . C. tetani produces a highly potent exotoxin , tetanospasmin , which is responsible for the clinical features of tetanus .
Detection of virus in respiratory specimens , stool or blood by RT-PCR ; virus isolation ; serology by IFA or ELISA . Specimen processing and testing should be performed under strict biosafety measures -LRB- BSL-3 -RRB- .
By mosquito bite . Experiments demonstrated human to human transmission with the mosquito as vector , but there is no direct human-to-human transmission .
Bartonella quintana -LRB- formerly Rochalimaea quintana and Rickettsia quintana -RRB- , a fastidious intracellular Gram-negative bacterium .
P. ovale initally was thought to be limited to Sub-Saharan Africa , Papua New Guinea , eastern Indonesia , and the Philippines . It is actually more widely distributed , and is reported in the Middle East , the Indian Subcontinent , and various parts of Southeast Asia . P. ovale has not yet been reported in South America . In general , P. ovale is relatively uncommon , though in West Africa prevalences above 10 % are observed . Also , infections are most common in children < 10 years . There is likely underreporting due to underdiagnosis . Due to the short duration of parasitemia and low parasite loads , P. ovale is regularly ` missed ' in cross-sectional surveys .
Personal protection from sandfly bites -LRB- e.g. protective clothing , insecticide-treated bednets , residual insecticiding of breeding places -RRB- .
By bite of the female sandfly -LRB- usually at dusk and at sundown , often indoors -RRB- ; rarely by blood transfusion or transplacental . There is no direct person-to-person transmission .
During bloodmeal , the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes . The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut , and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding . In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes .
Soil , animal hair , wool or hides , particularly goat skins contaminated with soil . Spores can germinate outside an animal under appropriate conditions .
Measles virus , a single-stranded RNA negative-sense morbillivirus , family Paramyxoviridae .
Among those infected , about 20 % develop acute watery diarrhea , of which 10 -- 20 % develop severe watery diarrhea with vomiting , leading to severe dehydration which may be lethal if not treated . The CFR is typically below 5 % , but in crowded refugee camps it can run as high as 50 % .

Anti-mosquito precautions .
Rarely by tick bite .
Sudden onset of fever lasting 2 -- 7 days , sometimes biphasic , severe headache , myalgia , arthralgia , retro-orbital pain , anorexia , nausea , vomiting and a maculopapular rash -LRB- not easily seen on dark skin -RRB- . Most cases recover . Minor occurrence of petechiae , epistaxis , or gingival bleeding may be seen . Serious hemorrhagic manifestations , like a severe drop in blood platelets , indicate dengue hemorrhagic fever -LRB- DHF -RRB- , that can progress to dengue shock syndrome -LRB- DSS -RRB- and death . Infection with any serotype results in lasting homologous immunity , but little cross-immunity to other serotypes . Cross-immunity may exacerbate , rather than diminish , disease severity when infected with a new serotype ; DHF leading to DSS can occur as a secondary infection with a different serotype , but DHF/DSS has also been reported in primary infections . CFR for DHF is up to 20 % , for untreated DSS up to 50 % , and 1 -- 2 % if correctly treated .
Humans . Loa loa also infects some monkeys but the human and simian cycles seem to be independent .
Transmission to humans occurs by rubbing infected louse feces into abraded skin or into the conjunctivae .
Uncomplicated malaria : acute febrile illness with headache , chills , sweats , nausea , and vomiting ; hepatosplenomegaly . Findings of severe malaria can be : cerebral malaria -LRB- confusion , seizures , impaired consciousness to coma -RRB- , hemolysis , severe anemia , hypotension , renal failure , metabolic acidosis and death . Often high parasite counts are found in patients with severe malaria -LRB- > 5 % infected erythrocytes -RRB- .
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown . Antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign , or misdiagnosed and underreported . Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide , mainly during the rainy season . Cases have been reported in dryer areas , like northeastern Brazil and north Iran . This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields . In Southeast Asia , it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water . In northeast Thailand , 20 % of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis , which accounts for 39 % of fatal septicemias and 36 % of fatal community-acquired pneumonias . Up to 80 % of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes , chronic renal disease , or alcoholism , age , chronic infection , or immunosuppressive therapy . Sporadic human infections with glanders -LRB- B. mallei -RRB- , occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists , horse butchers , and laboratory workers .
Food-borne and transplacental -LRB- mother to child -RRB- . Ingestion of L. monocytogenes occurs commonly world wide . Development of the disease depends on the host immunity .
Tetracyclines , chloramphenicol , or penicillins for 7 days have all been shown to be effective for treating TBRF . LBRF can be treated with a single dose of antibiotics . When initiating antibiotic therapy , watch closely for a Jarisch -- Herxheimer reaction .
By animal bite through saliva commonly or scratch -LRB- rarely -RRB- . Infected livestock do not bite typically , but may infect a person through their saliva . Very rare : licks upon mucosal surfaces ; aerosols in bat-infested caves ; person-toperson transmission via organ/tissue transplantation . Rabies can be transmitted via slaughtering of infected reservoir species , for instance dogs in countries where dogs are consumed .
Rotavirus , a non-enveloped double-stranded RNA virus within the Reoviridae family , is classified into 7 rotavirus groups -LRB- A -- G -RRB- as determined by the antigenic properties of the VP6 capsid protein . Group A is most common in human disease , with B and C to a lesser extent . Subgroups and serotypes are determined by seroand genotyping the epitopes P and G , of the VP4 and VP7 outer capsid proteins , respectively . These proteins are relevant for vaccine efficacy .
Early diagnosis and treatment ; safe sexual practices -LRB- condom use -RRB- . Proper bodily hygiene .
Consumption , white plague , TB .
Microscopy for eggs on stool samples by the Kato -- Katz or rapid sedimentation techniques -LRB- RSTs -RRB- are diagnostic for the chronic infection . Serological tests -LRB- Fas2ELISA -RRB- is recommended for acute infection . The intradermal test is rapid and sensitive , but as it is not sufficiently specific it is no longer used . Radiology , such as computed tomography , can demonstrate liver lesions -LRB- only in acute infection -RRB- similar to metatastic lesions . For chronic infections , a cholangiogram can detect bile duct pathology caused by the adult parasites .
Hendra virus : manage contact between fruit bats and horse by basic husbandry measures such as placing food and water points under cover , regulate movement of horses from areas where the disease is occurring , regulate import of horses from Australia during outbreaks . Nipah virus : avoid contact with fruit bats and their discharges ; wash and peel fruit , and wash hands before and after preparing fruit ; regulate importation of pigs from outbreak areas .
Wildlife -- tick -- wildlife . The tick ingests infected blood of reservoir host , virus passes from gut to hemocoele to salivary glands and is transmitted to a new host at the next feed . The virus is transmitted from tick to tick trans-stadially and transovarially . Trans-stadial transmission is key to tickborne infections .
Humans
Junin virus is spread annually around harvest time by rodents to farmers . The range of Junin virus is extending to the north , putting an estimated 5 million people at risk . The other viruses are brought into villages and houses by peridomestic rodents , causing sporadic outbreaks with intervals of several years . Deforestation and human invasion into rodent habitat may have resulted in increased human exposure to infected rodents and a concomitant increase in human illnesses -LRB- see Forest Cover map -RRB- . Only single cases of an infection by Sabia and Chapare viruses have been recorded . Pathogenicity of Whitewater Arroyo virus remains to be confirmed since there was no virus isolation from the Californian cases .
It is an occupational risk for those working in the environment in endemic regions -LRB- e.g. farmers , soldiers -RRB- . Dust control where feasible -LRB- e.g. paving roads -RRB- . Arthroconidia are resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can survive for many years in dust . Screening of organ donors for coccidioidomycosis in endemic areas . As the fungus is easily aerosolized it is a laboratory hazard .

Anthrax has a worldwide distribution . Livestock vaccination , antibiotic treatment , and quarantaine regulations lead to a strong decline in anthraxinfections in domestic lifestock . Anthrax occurs mainly in rural areas in countries where there is no livestock vaccination and no veterinary control of slaughtered animals.There is a seasonal variation in animal disease with an increase in cases during hot dry weather . Anthrax is an occupational hazard for people who process contaminated animal tissues . GI anthrax occurs when infected tissue is ingested . Of note is the terrorist distribution of anthrax powder by mail in the USA in 2001 , which killed 5 people and produced sickness in 17 .
Tick-borne encephalitis -LRB- TBE -RRB- virus , an enveloped RNA virus with three subtypes : Tick-borne encephalitis -LRB- TBE -RRB- virus , an enveloped
RVFV primarily causes disease in animals in Africa and Middle East , with human cases occurring during animal epidemics . Humans that regularly work with animals -LRB- farmers , herders , veterinarians , slaughterhouse workers -RRB- are at increased risk of infection . Epidemics in animals occur when mosquito populations dramatically increase after periods of heavy rainfall or the production of wetlands behind man-made dams . RVF was initially confined to Sub-Saharan Africa , but appeared in Egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the Arabian Peninsula -LRB- Saudi Arabia and Yemen -RRB- in 2000 and later also on the Comoros Islands . As RVFV epidemics are closely associated with above-average rainfall , outbreaks can be forecasted upon which preventive measures can be implemented .
Taeniosis : detection of eggs in stool by microscopy ; T. solium eggs can not be distinguished from T. saginata eggs ; serology ; Neurocysticercosis : histology ; CT or MRI scan brain ; serology is not sensitive or specific for neurocysticercosis .
90 % of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic ; 10 % develop invasive-intestinal disease -LRB- colitis -RRB- , and < 1 % extra-intestinal disease -LRB- liver abscess -RRB- . Amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps , weight loss , and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea ; most patients are afebrile . Amebic colitis rarely progresses to necrotizing colitis , ameboma , and toxic megacolon . Amebic colitis affects children and adults equally , but mainly males . Amebic liver-abscess mainly occurs in men aged 18 to 50 years , for unknown reasons . E. moshkovskii can cause non-invasive diarrhea .
Foxes -LRB- including urban foxes -RRB- are the definitive hosts , wild rodents -LRB- mainly Arvicolidae -RRB- , voles and lemmings are intermediate hosts . Foxes have extended their distribution into urban areas , partly due to a decrease in rabies deaths in foxes since rabies vaccination .
The disease is self-limiting and acute symptoms are similar to acute hepatitis A disease . Children are generally asymptomatic or have mild disease . Clinical evident disease is more common in age group 15 -- 44 years , with following symptoms : fatigue , fever , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , jaundice , dark urine , and light stool . Pregnant women are at risk for severe disease , including fulminant hepatitis and death . In immunocompromised persons -LRB- e.g. transplant recipients or users of immune-modulating therapy -RRB- chronic infection has been reported .
LFV was isolated from a missionary nurse living in Lassa , Nigeria , in 1969 . It is estimated there are 200,000 to 300,000 symptomatic Lassa fever cases in West Africa each year , with an associated mortality of 5,000 to 10,000 . Lassa fever occurs in two geographically distinct regions : the Mano River region -LRB- Guinea , Sierra Leone , Liberia -RRB- in the West , and Nigeria in the East . In the dry season , the multi-mammate rat gathers in houses , and in the rainy season , the rat forages in the surrounding fields . Villages with Lassa fever are all located in rain forest areas or transition zones of rainforest to savannah , where the mean annual rainfall is above 1,500 mm and below 3,000 mm . LFV can be transmitted from rodents to humans both in the rainy and the dry season . However , in the dry season there may be an increased risk for humans due to aggregation of the rats in their houses .

ILEV and NRIV can cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks . CVV rarely causes encephalitis , with only one fatal case reported in the USA in 1995 .
Hib is a common invasive bacterial infection that primarily causes pneumonia , meningitis , and bacteremia . Pneumonia due to Hib is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of bacterial pneumonia . Hib meningitis may present acutely or subacutely with fever , vomiting , lethargy , irritability , and a bulging fontanelle in infants or a stiff neck in older children . Bacteremia may be present with meningitis or pneumonia but may also occur without an obvious focus of infection . Hib may also cause epiglottitis , which presents with fever , sore throat , and difficulty swallowing , talking and breathing . Infections of soft tissue , bones , and joints with H. influenzae may occur .
Self-limiting disease . Sudden onset of joint pain ; fatigue , marked arthralgia and myalgia in more than 40 % , stiff and swollen joints in 60 -- 85 % of cases ; anorexia , headache , back pain , photophobia , sore throat , lethargy , and lymphadenopathy also occur , with fever and a maculopapular rash , usually on the trunk and limbs but also on palms and soles , in 50 % of cases . Relapses occur ; joint pains and swelling may relapse for as long as 6 years . Patients eventually recover completely .

Most infections are asymptomatic or mild and resolve without treatment . The acute phase begins with fever , malaise , chest pains and a dry cough . Chest X-ray findings are normal in 40 -- 70 % of cases . Severe infections result in mediastinitis , hepatosplenomegaly , lymphadenopathy and adrenal enlargement . Osteomyelitis is rare . Disseminated disease occurs in patients with altered cellular immunity such as individuals with AIDS and those receiving immunosuppressive medications . It presents with systemic complaints and multiple organ involvement : lung , spleen , bone marrow , adrenals , CNS and GI tract being the most affected .

The highest global burden of CL is in the Old World . In the Americas , Bolivia , Brazil , and Peru have the highest burden of CL . In the New World , CL mainly occurs in forested areas , whereas in the Old World it is associated with semi-arid and desert regions . Transmision can also occur in deforested areas . Disease mainly occurs in those living or working in the forests of endemic areas . Outbreaks can occur during military training in the jungle or infrastructural projetcs in endemic areas . Also , travelers acquire the disease during visits to rural or jungle regions . Disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus , likely due to acquired immunity . Clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households , which is probably related to the short flight range of sandflies .
Descending flaccid skeletal muscle paralysis beginning at the shoulders in the absence of fever ; fatigue , weakness , vertigo , blurred vision , dry mouth , difficulty in speaking and swallowing , progressing to an inability to breathe without assistance . Vomiting , diarrhea or constipation may occur . The CFR in the USA after treatment is 5 -- 10 % ; recovery may take months . Infants present with constipation , anorexia , weakness , an altered cry , difficulty sucking , and swallowing . Muscle weakness progresses in a symmetric descending fashion over hours to a few days . The prognosis is excellent when treated timely .
F. tularensis tularensis Type A is found in North America and the distribution is associatedwith wild rabbits , ticks , and tabanid flies . Type B is found throughout the northern hemisphere , mainly in Eurasia and is associated with multiple rodent species , hares , ticks , blood-feeding mosquitoes , and tabanid flies . There is also an association with water bodies -LRB- streams -RRB- and flooding . In the USA , around 200 human tularemia cases are reported each year , mostly in rural areas during summer months . In Europe , most cases are reported from Sweden , Finland , and Russia , and is recently emerging in Spain . Rural populations are most at risk -LRB- e.g. farmers , hunters -RRB- . Human outbreaks often coincide with wild animal outbreaks .
Gastric anisakidosis : findings depend on where in the gastrointestinal tract the ingested larvae embed . Gastric anisakidosis is the predominant form with acute severe gastric pain , nausea , and vomiting and sometimes hematemesis . Intestinal anisakiasis can cause abdominal pain , obstruction , peritonitis , ulceration , and bleeding . Anisakis-associated hypersensitivity is increasingly being reported and varies from acute urticaria to anaphylaxis . Pharyngeal anisakiasis is rare with pharyngeal irritation as the main symptom .
Rarely reported in the Americas and Europe , sporadic in parts of Southeast Asia , especially Thailand , China , and Vietnam . Most important risk factor is contact with pigs or uncooked pig products , typically by farmers , veterinary personnel , abattoir workers , and butchers . Furthermore , in several Asian countries it is common to consume uncooked pork products , like blood , which is a risk for acquiring the disease . Individuals who are immunosuppressed , including those who have been splenectomized , are also at increased risk . Since S. suis is often misidentified , S. suis may be more common in certain parts of the world with high pig densities .
Malaria requires urgent treatment and type of treatment depends on disease severity and drug resistance in the region . Artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in the Thai -- Cambodian border region . Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria : artemisinin-based combination therapies -LRB- ACTs -RRB- ; the choice of ACTs is based on the resistance levels of the partner medicine in the combination . Artemisinin and its derivatives should not be used as monotherapy . Severe malaria : artesunate iv or im ; complete treatment with an ACT or artesunate plus doxycycline or clindamycin .
Main transmission is fecal -- oral , but houseflies act as supplementary vectors by contaminating food after feeding on exposed human feces .
Direct transmission via skin to skin or oral contact -LRB- also via sharing drinking and eating utensils -RRB- . Sharing of drinking vessels plays an important role in transmission of endemic syphilis in arid regions . There is little or no mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy .
Dry , sandy alkaline soil in the semi-arid zones of the USA -- Mexico border and parts of Central and South America . In North America , the fungus is mainly found in the Lower Sonoran Life Zone with low rainfall and high temperatures C. immitis is present in California , and probably northern Mexico and Arizona , and C. posadasii is present in the remaining areas .
Unclear , but likely through inhalation of P. marneffei conidia from the environment ; cutaneous inoculation may also occur . There is no human-to-human transmission .
By tsetse fly bite -LRB- day biters -RRB- ; blood transfusion , and congenital .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment .
Q fever has been described world wide , with the exception of New Zealand . Though small outbreaks are reported from tropical countries , serological studies do show that the prevalence of disease is higher there than in temperate regions . Most human outbreaks involve either goats or sheep . The largest global outbreak ever reported occurred in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2010 , mainly in the southeast where there is a high density of dairy goat farms . The outbreak led to a high incidence of infections in people exposed to aerosols living in the vicinity of infected farms but had no occupational exposure . People living within 2 km of a farm had a much higher risk than those living > 5km away . The hospitalization rate was relatively high , 20 % versus around 5 % which is normally reported .
