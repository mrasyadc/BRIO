MAYV is enzootic in the humid tropical rainforests of South America . Infections peak in the rainy season when the mosquito vectors are most abundant . Most human cases occur sporadically and involve persons who work or reside in humid tropical forest ; several small outbreaks of Mayaro fever have been described in residents of rural communities of the Amazon region of Brazil , Bolivia , and Peru . Travelers have imported MAYV from Surinam to the Netherlands and from Brazil into France . The virus has been detected in migratory birds .
In the absence of vaccination , Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5 . In developed countries -LRB- prior to immunization -RRB- , Hib was the commonest cause of bacterial meningitis in young children , but in countries with high vaccination coverage Hib is now almost eliminated as a public health problem . In developing countries Hib meningitis is common but Hib pneumonia appears to be even more common , with pneumonia morbidity and mortality exceeding that of meningitis . In 2000 Hib is estimated to have caused around 8 million cases of severe invasive disease and 360,000 deaths in children under 5 years of age . Ten countries , all in Africa and Asia , accounted for an estimated 61 % of all these Hib deaths . Hib pneumonia is estimated to be responsible for around 16 % of pneumonia deaths in HIV-negative children , therefore Hib makes an important contribution to the high childhood mortality rates and low life expectancy of Sub-Saharan Africa . Global coverage with three doses of Hib vaccine was estimated at 28 % in 2008 , with overall coverage of around 90 % in the Americas , 65 % in Europe , 40 % in Africa , and less than 5 % in Asia and the Pacific . The introduction of Hib vaccination has however been accelerating and by the end of 2009 , in 83 % of WHO Member States -LRB- 160/193 -RRB- , Hib is included in the national immunization schedule .
Historically , dracunculiasis was endemic in 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia , with an incidence of 3.5 million cases per year -LRB- 1986 -RRB- . An international control effort reduced that to just over 1,785 cases detected in five African countries by 2010 : Mali , Ghana , South Sudan , Chad , and Ethiopia . Nearly 95 % of the cases are reported from South Sudan . Additionally , Niger reported 3 imported cases from Mali . Chad did not report cases for more than 10 years when an outbreak occurred with 10 cases in 2010 . In Mali and Southern Sudan , violence has interfered with the eradication campaign , but Ghana and Ethiopia are close to eradication . Ghana diagnosed their last indigenous case in May 2010 . Dracunculiasis mainly affects poor communities without a safe portable water supply and is mainly limited to remote nomadic communities . There is a marked increase in infection in the dry season when stagnant pools are the only source of water . Most cases are young -LRB- working -RRB- adults who may be exposed to contaminated water sources more frequently . There is no particular age or sex predilection . Countries free of transmission neighboring endemic countries should remain alert for imported cases and take adequate preventive measures .
Mumps is preventable by the use of live attenuated mumps virus vaccines . Various vaccine strains are available and may vary in immunogenicity and the incidence of adverse effects , such as fever , rash , parotitis , or meningitis .

Ticks of the genera Amblyomma and Ixodes .
A combination of several ARVs is recommended , known as Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy -LRB- HAART -RRB- . Additional strategies include prophylaxis and vaccination against opportunistic infections , general measures to maintain nutrition and health , and treatment of specific infections or HIV-associated disorders .
Rabies occurs in more than 150 countries and territories ; world wide , more than 55,000 people die of rabies every year ; 40 % of people who are bitten by suspect rabid animals are children under 15 years of age . Dogs are the source of 99 % of human rabies deaths , which is largely due to low rabies vaccination coverage of dogs in developing countries . Most cases of rabies in North America and Australia have been acquired from bats , often with no documented record of a bite . The USA was declared free of canine rabies transmission in 2007 . In the Americas , dog rabies control reduced human cases to 16 by 2009 . Every year , more than 15 million people world wide receive a preventive PEP regimen to avert the disease -- this is estimated to prevent more than 327,000 rabies deaths annually .

Food-borne trematodiasis is focal and occurs in areas where the snail and freshwater fish -- that is consumed raw or undercooked -- coexist . The disease is the leading cause of cholangiocarcinoma in the world . O. viverrini is common in Southeast Asia in the Mekong region with 8 million infected in Thailand and 2 million in Laos . In Thailand about 8.7 % of the population is infected and mainly in the northern provinces . Control activities in Thailand were able to reduce the prevalence from 34 % to 10 % in several areas . No data is available for Cambodia , China , or Vietnam , although opisthorchiasis is likely common there . O. felineus is found in Europe and northern Asia with approximately 5 million infected . Infected fish can be shipped and consumed in non-endemic areas .

Demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in Giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy ; PCR tests have been developed for the different Leishmania species ; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience . The Montenegro skin test is simple , sensitive and specific , but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections .
Depends on portal of entry . The skin lesion is a characteristic black eschar surrounded by edema , usually on the head , forearms or hands , accompanied by malaise and fever , in 80 % of cases resolving spontaneously after 7 -- 10 days , but if left untreated it may evolve into fatal septicemia . GI anthrax produces nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fever , hematemesis , occasionally bloody diarrhea and often fatal septicemia and shock . Inhalation anthrax is rapidly progressive and starts with fever , malaise and mild cough and chest pain , evolving to acute respiratory distress , diagnostic mediastinal widening , cyanosis and shock . Untreated cutaneous anthrax has a CFR of 5 -- 20 % -LRB- < 1 % with treatment -RRB- , GI anthrax 25 -- 60 % , and inhalation anthrax 100 % -LRB- 75 % with treatment -RRB- .

Rats are the main host species involved in human rat bite fever for both agents . The main location for S. moniliformis in rats is the pharynx . S. minusis mainly present in the blood and tongue of rats and salivary glands of mice . Other rodent species such as mouse , squirrel , and gerbil -- and non-rodent species -- have occasionally been identified as possible sources of infection . The rat population is estimated to be 10 billion , which is one-third of the total global mammalian population .

A progressive chronic illness of the skin and mucous membranes in the genital and perigenital regions with painless granulomatous ulcers and regional lymphadenopathy . Nodular skin lesions can appear as lymphadenopathy , known as ` pseudobulbar . ' The painless lesions are often found in warm moist body regions and bleed easily . Lesions can be progressive and cause local tissue destruction . Systemic spread is rare but bones and internal organs may eventually be infected .
Mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito . There is an enzootic cycle , mainly between C. taralsis and passerine birds . There is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits . Viremia lasts 2 -- 5 days in birds . Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days . Humans and horses are dead-end hosts for WEEV because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes .
Treat patients to reduce the T. b. gambiense reservoir , and cattle to reduce the T. b. rhodesiense reservoir ; screen blood donations ; vector control : fly traps , insecticide-treated screens , ground and aerial spraying , release of sterile male tsetse flies .
The disease mainly affects the skin , peripheral nerves , mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes , shown by patches of pigmented or reddish skin with loss of sensation , peripheral nerve enlargement with loss of sensation , sometimes paralysis , muscle wasting and trophic ulcers . Patients are classified as having either PL or ML . PL is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions . ML is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions . Skin lesions are often symmetric . Involvement of the nasal mucosa results in nasal congestion and epistaxis . Reduced sensation of digits may lead to their loss due to trauma . Up to 10 % of cases with early lesions may resolve spontaneously .
Leprosy control is achieved by timely detection and treatment of new cases . BCG vaccination provides variable protection : from 34 % to 80 % . Chemoprophylaxis and quarantine are not recommended .

HIV was first recognized clinically in 1981 . As of 2009 , over 25 million people are estimated to have died from HIV and around 33 million people are living with HIV . HIV epidemics are categorized into ` low-level ' -LRB- HIV prevalence < 1 % in the general population and < 5 % in vulnerable group such as MSM , injecting drug users , sex workers -RRB- ; ` concentrated ' -LRB- HIV prevalence < 1 % in the general population but > 5 % in at least one vulnerable group -RRB- ; and ` generalized ' -LRB- HIV prevalence > 1 % in the general population -RRB- . The greatest burden of HIV continues to fall on Sub-Saharan Africa , with 68 % of all people living with HIV and 72 % of all HIV-related deaths in 2009 . The epidemic in Africa is , however , heterogeneous , with high-prevalence generalized epidemics in Southern African countries ; generalized but moderate prevalence epidemics in Central , East and West Africa , and low-level epidemics in North Africa . No countries in Asia have a generalized epidemic . HIV-1 can be divided in four groups -LRB- M , O , N , and P -RRB- . Over 90 % of HIV-1 infections are group M and the map opposite shows the distribution of the 9 subtypes -LRB- clades -RRB- and recombinants of the M group HIV-1 viruses .
Pig-to-pig , with occasional spill-over to humans .
Direct person-to-person transmission , usually following close contact with a symptomatic case or the respiratory secretions or body fluids of a symptomatic case . Healthcare facilities were key in amplifying the transmission of SARS in 2003 . Respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces are thought to be the principal routes of transmission , although one outbreak in a residential block in Hong Kong was attributed to aerosol spread .

Zika virus is present in the tropical regions in the Old World and is absent from the Americas -LRB- a single case in the USA was imported from Yap island -RRB- . The competence of mosquitoes on the American continent for Zika virus is unknown . The geographic distribution is confirmed by virus isolation from cases , mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys . Positive results in serosurveys are not conclusive , because of extensive cross-reactions among flaviviruses . In 2007 a virgin soil epidemic affected 73 % of the population of Yap island . There were no hospitalizations or deaths during this outbreak . Due to intense air travel in the Pacific region and presence of competent vectors , there is concern that the disease will spread to other islands and even beyond . Adult females have higher attack rates and few cases are found above the age of 60 years . Approximately 18 % of individuals infected by the Zika virus develop symptoms ; this is similar to that reported for West Nile virus infection .
Rodent to rodent with spill over to humans in case of adequate exposure .
Pulmonary distomiasis , lung fluke disease
Eggs hatch in water and release miracidia larvae that penetrate the snail , where they develop to cercariae that encyst on aquatic plants -LRB- e.g. watercress -RRB- and become desiccation resistant metacercariae . After the plants are eaten by herbivores -LRB- e.g. sheep , cattle -RRB- , or water containing metacercariae is drunk , the larvae pass through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity , enter the liver , and lay eggs in the bile duct , which are then excreted in the feces . The whole cycle takes 3 to 4 months .
Avoid exposure to feces of reservoir species wash hands , fruit and vegetables , periodically treat high-risk dogs , eliminate ownerless dogs . Praziquantel-containing baits have reduced infection in urban foxes and water voles in Switzerland and Germany . Eggs are highly sensitive to elevated temperatures and desiccation , but survive for months at freezing temperatures and are not affected by common disinfectants or ethanol .
Tree-hole-breeding forest mosquitoes : Aedes spp . in Africa , and Haemagogus and Sabethes spp . in South America . Transovarian transmission occurs in the mosquito and may be the way the virus survives in the years between cycles . The urban vector on both continents is Aedes aegypti .

The precise mechanism is unclear : probably by aerosol spread of nasal secretions from a case to respiratory mucosa of close contacts . M. leprae can not cross intact skin . The relative risk for leprosy disease in household contacts is 8 to 10 for multibacillary -LRB- lepromatous -RRB- leprosy and 2 to 4 for paucibacillary -LRB- tuberculoid -RRB- leprosy .
S. stercoralis has a free-living -LRB- asexual -RRB- and parasitic -LRB- sexual -RRB- lifecycle . Free-living filariform -LRB- L3 -RRB- larvae in the soil penetrate the skin , enter the bloodstream , reach the lungs , travel up to the throat , and are swallowed . In the duododenal wall they mature into adult female worms , produce eggs that hatch immediately , thus only larvae -LRB- L1 -RRB- are excreted . These non-infectious -LRB- L1 -RRB- larvae develop further in the soil into either adult worms or infectious -LRB- L3 -RRB- larvae . Some non-infectious L1 larvae may develop faster into infectious L3 larvae in the human intestine and penetrate the perianal skin or colon wall . This process of auto-infection may lead to hyperinfection in immunocompromised individuals .
Small rodents -LRB- mice , voles , rats -RRB- and insectivores -LRB- shrews , hedgehogs -RRB- are the most common animal reservoirs of Borrelia , while larger animals -LRB- deer , livestock -RRB- serve as hosts for the tick vectors . Hares and birds may also serve as reservoirs . Ticks by trans-stadial transmission ; transovarial transmission in ticks is limited .
Chinese liver fluke , Oriental liver fluke .
VL is found in 62 countries where an estimated 500,000 cases occur annually and 120 million persons are at risk . Approximately 90 % of VL cases occur in rural and suburban areas of five countries : Bangladesh , India , Nepal , Sudan , and Brazil . During epidemics , > 5 % of a population may develop symptomatic infection . Persons who are under age of 5 years , malnourished and immunocompromised -LRB- including HIV-infected individuals -RRB- are more likely to develop symptomatic , often severe , infection . There are indications that VL is spreading to historically nonendemic areas , like northern parts of Europe and Western Upper Nile Sudan . Clearly the distribution of VL is dynamic and adapts to changes in demographics , human behavior , environment -LRB- deforestation , urbanization -RRB- , and host factors -LRB- HIV -RRB- .

MPV is endemic in heavily forested areas of Africa , primarily of low altitude and high humidity . The outlier in shrub country in the Sudan is anomalous ecologically and might have been initiated by an infected traveler from the Congo Basin region . Males and females are equally affected , children under 15 more than adults . Comparison of active surveillance data in one health zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the 1980s -LRB- 0.72 per 10,000 -RRB- and 2006 -- 2007 -LRB- 14.5 per 10,000 -RRB- suggests a 20-fold increase in human monkeypox incidence 30 years after mass smallpox vaccination ceased in that country . In 2003 , multiple cases of monkeypox occurred across the USA among persons who had contact with the excretions of sick prairie dogs -LRB- native ground squirrels -RRB- either at a child-care center or from pet stores . The animals had been exposed to imported , infected West African rodents on the premises of a distributor of exotic pets . There were more than 70 cases but no fatalities .

Most South and several Central American countries between 23 N and 34 S have paracoccidioidomycosis endemic regions , particularly Brazil , Colombia , Venezuela , and Argentina . The prevalence of paracoccidioidomycosis in endemic areas can be up to 75 % in adults , with active disease developing in approximately 2 % of infected individuals . The endemic areas are generally forest areas with many water streams , mild temperatures , a short winter , and a summer with moderate rain . The disease mainly affects active rural workers -LRB- coffee , cotton , and tobacco farmers -RRB- , probably due to environmental exposure . This explains why the disease is more common in men aged 30 to 60 years . Postpubertal women are partially protected by estrogen that prevents the fungus from transitioning to the yeast form . Contact with nine-banded armadillos has also been shown to be a risk factor for paracoccidioidomycosis .
Maduromycosis , Madura foot
Enterotoxin-producing Vibrio cholerae 01 and 0139 Bengal . Serogroup 01 has two biotypes , classical and El Tor , each with three serotypes : Inaba , Ogawa , and the rarer Hikojima .
The nematodes : Anisakis simplex , A. physeteris , Pseudoterranova decipiens , and Contracaecum spp . A. simplex and P. decipiens are the most important species for human disease . Anisakis larvae are whitish , tightly coiled , 1.5 -- 2 cm in length , and difficult to see in fish flesh . Pseudoterranova larvae are 2 -- 3 cm in length and red to brown in color .
Fleas , especially the rat flea -LRB- Xenopsylla cheopis -RRB- and possibly human flea -LRB- Pulex irritans -RRB- .
Antibiotic treatment with a macrolide antibiotic is mainly indicated to reduce communicability in those presenting within 3 weeks of onset . Hospitalization may be needed in severe causes for supportive care .
Demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in Giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy ; PCR tests have been developed for the different Leishmania species ; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience . The Montenegro skin test is simple , sensitive and specific , but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections .
Taeniosis : praziquantel . Neurocysticercosis : Treatment must be individualized case by case but could include cestocidal drugs -LRB- albendazole or praziquantel -RRB- , symptomatic measures -LRB- antiepileptic drugs , oedema reducing drugs , ventriculoperitoneal shunt -RRB- and removal by neurosurgery -LRB- limited indications -RRB- .
Early stage disease : suramin for T. b. rhodesiense , pentamidine forT . b. gambiense ; Late stage disease : melarsoprol for both forms ; eflornithine with or without nifurtimox for gambiense . These drugs can cause SAEs .
Vector control ; mosquito repellent ; insecticidetreated bed nets ; residual spraying of insecticides ; treatment of infected humans . Recently control measures are being upscaled in a malaria elimination effort . Morocco , United Arab Emirates , and Turkmenistan have been certified malaria free by WHO .
Consumption of raw or undercooked uneviscerated fish that have ingested infected feces of humans or waterfowl . There is no person-to-person transmission .
For LBRF , humans ; for TBRF , wild rodents , bats and ticks -LRB- by trans-stadial and transovarian transmission -RRB- . B. duttonii has thus far not been detected in wild animals , only in humans and tick vector O. moubata . Livestock may also become infected .
Large marsupials , particularly kangaroos and wallabies .
The majority of the cases -LRB- 70 -- 80 % -RRB- are asymptomatic . Sudden onset of fever , headache , malaise , myalgia , arthralgia , abdominal pain and upset , nausea , sore throat , conjunctivitis , lymphadenopathy , and frequently a maculopapular rash . Less than 1 % of infected persons develop neuroinvasive disease . Neurological disorders are more frequent in the elderly and immunocompromised , and may be fatal , with the exception of the Kunjin strain . After 5 years 60 % of patients who presented with neuroinvasive disease continued to report weakness , fatigue , memory loss , and ataxia .
VEEV was isolated for the first time in 1938 from a diseased horse in Venezuela . The VEEV distribution is limited to the Americas , and predominantly in Central and South America . In 1995 , a large outbreak with approximately 100,000 human cases , of which 300 were fatal , happened in Colombia and Venezuela . The Guajira peninsula -LRB- region in northern Colombia and northwest Venezuela -RRB- has the highest disease burden , probably due to a large donkey population that serves as an amplifying host . In 2005 , human VEE cases were detected for the first time in Bolivia , cause by a new Bolivia -- Peru ID genotype . Typical VEEV enzootic habitats are lowland forests and swamps in -LRB- sub -RRB- tropical areas of the Americas , from northern Argentina up to southern USA -LRB- Florida and Colorado -RRB- . Enzootic subtype distribution generally does not overlap , except in the Amazon regions .
Often misidentified as P. malariae , but skilled microscopists are able to make the distinction . A relatively severe illness with a microscopic diagnosis of P. malariae should alert clinicians to the possibility of P. knowlesi because P. malariae malaria is almost invariably mild . Species can be confirmed by PCR if needed .
Long-tailed and pigtailed macaques , and banded leaf monkeys . P. knowlesi can also infect other primates , including New World marmosets -LRB- Callithrix jacchus -RRB- , African olive baboons -LRB- Papio anubis -RRB- , Old World macaques , and humans by blood passage and mosquito bites .

Epidemic hepatitis , infectious hepatitis , infectious jaundice , catarrhal jaundice .
Visual inspection for adult worm protruding from the skin lesion ; microscopic identification of larvae released when lesion is immersed in water .
Human infection is associated with cold waters in the northern hemisphere . A 2005 estimate stated that 20 million people were infected world wide . It is common in communities , as in Japan , that have a habit of eating raw or undercooked fish . Risky fish dishes are sushi , sashimi , South American ceviche , fish carpaccio , salmon tartare , and salted or marinated fillets in Scandinavia or Baltic region . Historically , Finland and Alaska had a high disease prevalence , but this has decreased due to preventive measures . Women seem more at risk , probably due to being involved in meal preparation . The disease incidence is increasing in some countries such as Russia , South Korea , Japan , and Brazil . Cases are also reported from regions where diphyllobothriasis was expected to have been eliminated , such as Alpine lakes in Switzerland , northern Italy , and eastern France . It is not clear whether the cases reported in Hawaii and Brazil are autochthonous or from imported fish . D. nihonkaiense , present in Japan and far eastern Russia , has been reported from a patient who ate raw Pacific sockeye salmon -LRB- Oncorhynchus nerka -RRB- from British Columbia , Canada . D. pacificum -LRB- formerly D. arctocephalinum -RRB- is increasingly reported as a human parasite along the coast of South America . Infected fish can be transported to any part of the world for consumption .
The diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical features . The bacterium is usually not cultured from wounds and a positive culture does not confirm the diagnosis .
Neisseria meningitidis , a Gram-negative aerobic diplococcus . Pathogenic N. meningitidis produce a polysaccharide capsule , used for serogrouping . Five serogroups are responsible for most cases : A , B , C , W135 , and Y.

Weil disease , swamp fever , cane cutters disease , hemorrhagic jaundice , swineherd disease .
WHO estimates that 50,000 to 70,000 people are infected each year , with about 60 million people at risk in 36 countries . The disease distribution is limited by the range of the tsetse fly vector . Cases outside the tsetse fly distribution are likely imported . The disease distribution is patchy , with discrete foci and little to no disease between these foci . It is a disease of poverty and mainly occurs in remote rural areas . African trypanosomiasis was close to eradication through a variety of control programs , a loosening of these control programs caused the disease to reemerge in the 1980s . However , recent disease control programs are reversing this trend . The chronic gambiense form in West and Central Africa accounts for 95 % of cases and is seperated from rhodesiense by the Great Rift Valley . Uganda is the sole country reporting both forms , with rhodesiense in the south and gambiense in the northwest .
None .
Humans .
Eggs excreted by the mammalian host in the feces into freshwater are ingested by the snail vector . They hatch and in 2 months pass through various stages in the snail to produce motile cercariae , which leave the snail and penetrate freshwater fish . In 6 weeks the cercariae encyst , and when the fish is eaten by another mammalian host , they exit the cyst and penetrate the bile duct , where in a month they mature into adult worms and start to produce eggs .
The incidence of Noma and the prevalence of survivors of Noma are not well known . In 1998 , WHO estimated that 770,000 people had been affected in the past and survived the affection , and that 140,000 new cases were reported each year , of which 100,000 were between 1 and 7 years old and living in Sub-Saharan Africa . An estimation of the global incidence based on epidemiological field work in north-west Nigeria indicates 30,000 to 40,000 new cases per year . It occurs predominantly in debilitated and malnourished children , especially in underdeveloped countries . Peak incidence is at age 1 -- 4 years , the period of growth retardation in deprived children . The etiology is multifactorial : malnutrition , concurrent infections with malaria or measles , bad oral hygiene , severe diarrhea and severe necrotic ulcerative gingivitis are risk factors . In developed countries sporadic cases occur in immune-compromised patients , neonates , HIV-positive and diabetic patients .

Kala-azar -LRB- Hindi for black sickness -RRB- , black disease , dum-dum fever .
Fever , cough , hemoptysis , and pleuritic chest pain . Flukes may invade the brain and rarely the spinal cord , causing meningitis , intracranial hemorrhage , epilepsy , and paralysis . They may also cause acute and chronic inflammation of the pleura , pericardium , and mediastinum . Chest Xray findings are similar to tuberculosis . Complications include pleural effusion , pneumothorax , bronchiectasis , and pulmonary fibrosis .
Before 2004 , CHIKV was considered a minor arboviral disease , but since then has spread globally , infecting millions of people . Most cases are symptomatic . CHIKV has been endemic in Africa for centuries , typically causing small epidemics in rural areas . CHIKV spread to Asia within the last 60 years producing urban outbreaks , similar to dengue fever , involving Ae . egypti . The global epidemic started since a mutation in the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein gene -LRB- A226V -RRB- occurred , that enhanced its infectivity and transmission by Ae . albopictus . The mutated CHIKV is succesful in spreading in tropical and temperate regions where Ae . albopictus is present . In 2005 -- 2006 CHIKV spread from East Africa to virgin soil in the Indian Ocean Islands to produce epidemics affecting up to three-quarters of the population . Since 2006 , CHIKV outbreaks with are reported from several -LRB- sub -RRB- tropical countries in the new world . CHIKV virus was imported into several European countries and caused a small outbreak with autochthonous transmission in northern Italy . CHIKV-viremic travelers can cause autochthonous transmission in previous CHIKV-free areas if Ae . albopictus or other competent mosquitoes are present .
Direct : acid fast smear/culture and PCR of sputum and other body fluids , depending on clinical presentation ; serological : tuberculin skin test -LRB- Mantoux -RRB- ; interferon gamma release assays -LRB- IGRAs -RRB- . Culture in liquid media is gold standard and allows for antibiotic susceptibility testing but takes weeks to months ; PCR allows for early detection , and recent assays include detection of resistance-associated mutations .
Virus detection by RT-PCR of respiratory specimens is recommended ; virus culture requires a BSL-3 facility . Microneutralization assay is recommended to detect antibodies to A/H5N1 . Rapid antigen tests are not recommended due to lack of sensitivity .
Humans are the main reservoir ; non-human primates can be infected , rarely .
Symptomatic , there is no specific treatment .
Through breaks in skin , ingestion or aspiration of contaminated water , inhalation of contaminated dust . There are rare reports of transmission from human or animal cases to humans . Laboratory workers have been infected by aerosols .

Mebendazole or albendazole ; radical surgical excision .
Fox -- rodent -- fox -LRB- sylvatic cycle -RRB- . Foxes are the definitive hosts of the adult worm . Eggs are excreted with the feces and ingested by humans or the intermediate rodent host , where they hatch . The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and via the blood they reach the liver , lungs , brain , and heart . There they form metacestodes in which protoscolices develop . When the rodent is eaten by the definitive host , these attach to the small intestine and grow into adult worms . Occasionally wild carnivores -LRB- e.g. coyotes or wolves -RRB- can be definitive hosts . In some rural areas there is a synanthropic cycle in which dogs or cats are definitive hosts , acquiring the parasite from wild rodents .
Tetracycline , doxyxyline . Alternative : chloramphenicol .
Human-deer-fly-human . After infectivelarvae enter the wound they migrate and develop into adult worms in subcutaneous tissue . Adult worms produce microfilariae , that circulate in the peripheral blood in daytime and can be taken up by the next fly during feeding . In the fly they develop into larvae in 10 -- 12 days and enter the proboscis , and the cycle repeats . An infected human can remain infectious to the vector for up to 15 years . Transmission is facilitated by the fact that microfilaremia and the vector-biting activity occur in daytime .
Rift Valley fever virus -LRB- RVFV -RRB- , an enveloped , singlestranded tripartite RNA virus , belonging to the genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae . There are three lineages : Egyptian , West African , and East-Central African . Zinga virus , isolated in 1982 inMadagascar , was later found to be a strain of RVFV .
Humans are viremic at a titer high enough to infect mosquitoes for 3 to 7 days post illness onset . The virus travels from the mosquito gut to the salivary glands in 5 -- 7 days , after which it can infect another human by bite .
Standard anti-mosquito precautions .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment . Aspirin should be avoided .

Rapid card tests based on antibody detection have been produced with promising results -LRB- but not yet available commercially -RRB- . Luciferase immunoprecipitation system with a mixture of four O. volvulus antigens . Less-invasive techniques for disease surveillance are diethylcarbamazine patch tests -LRB- may become commercially available in near future -RRB- , which provoke a local Mazzotti skin reaction .
Supportive , there is no specific polio treatment .
World wide , but close to elimination in the Americas and targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015 . In the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95 % , but is most often over 50 % . Reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections . CRS is also grossly underreported . For example , it is estimated that over 45,000 CRS cases occur annually in Southeast Asia yet only an average of 13 CRS cases per year were reported to WHO between 2000 and 2009 . Rubella is a public health concern because of CRS and in 1996 it was estimated that 110,000 CRS cases occurred annually in developing countries . Paradoxically , a poor rubella immunization program may actually increase the incidence of CRS if the burden of illness is shifted to young adults , where pregnancy is common . Therefore rubella immunization programs must achieve and maintain high immunization rates -LRB- > 80 % -RRB- or be supplemented by the immunization of women of childbearing age . In 2009 two-thirds of countries included a rubella containing vaccine in their national immunization schedule yet in many developing countries rubella vaccine has not been included because of lack of information on the burden of CRS , costs , and concerns about causing a paradoxical increase in CRS cases .
Sudden onset of high fever -LRB- biphasic -RRB- , chills , myalgia , arthralgia , severe headache , ocular pain , conjunctivitis , anorexia , nausea , and sometimes vomiting . Spleen and liver can be palpable , and pericarditis or myocarditis may be found . A few cases have a petechial or maculopapular rash . Prolonged convalescence may follow . Children may have a more severe syndrome with hemorrhagic manifestations , including a more pronounced rash , DIC , and GI bleeding ; or CNS involvement including meningitis and encephalitis . Fatalities are rare .
Less than 1 % of infections result in acute flaccid paralysis , with around 90 % of infections being subclinical . In 10 % symptoms may include fever , malaise , headache , neck stiffness , pain in the limbs , nausea , and vomiting . Paralysis persists in 0.1 -- 1.0 % depending on the virulence of the strain . The flaccid paralysis is usually asymmetric and in one leg . The risk of paralysis is increased by intramuscular injections , immune-compromised state , trauma or surgery -LRB- tonsillectomy -RRB- , and intense physical activity during the incubation period . Also adults are at greater risk of developing paralysis than young children . Aseptic meningitis occurs in around 1 % of infections . More severe paralysis with quadriplegia and breathing problems -LRB- bulbar polio -RRB- may occur .
In 2000 , WHO started the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis that aims to interrupt transmission and reduce morbidity . Endemic areas are mapped with subsequent mass treatment for the population at-risk -LRB- see Therapy -RRB- for 5 years . Care needs to be taken in loiasis endemic areas to prevent adverse events -LRB- see Loiasis map -RRB- ; vector control -LRB- e.g. bed nets , repellent -RRB- .
Plasmodium falciparum , an intracellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa . Among the malaria parasites , P. falciparum causes the vast majority of mortality .
During bloodmeal , the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes . The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut , and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding . In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes .
Streptococcus pneumoniae -LRB- pneumococcus -RRB- , an encapsulated Gram-positive bacterium , with > 90 serotypes based on capsular polysaccharide antigens . Approximately 23 serotypes are responsible for 90 % if the infections in the developed world .

None .
Eggs develop in water in 3 -- 7 weeks , hatch producing miracidia which enter the intermediate snail hosts , in which they develop into cercariae . The cercariae encyst on water plants and develop to metacercariae . When ingested , the metacercariae excyst in the duodenum , where the flukes attach to the mucosa of the small intestine , mature , and start egg production in 2 to 3 months .
Boutonneuse fever -LRB- group name for R.conorii infections : MSF , ISF , ITT -RRB- , QTT and STT/NATT : mild febrile illness that may last up to 2 weeks , eschar at bite site with regional lymphadenopathy -LRB- in ISF , eschars are rare -RRB- , generalized maculopapular erythematous rash on palms on soles after 4 -- 5 days . The disease can be severe with a CFR up to 3 % . ATBF is milder than other rickettsioses , fever and rash are less common , multiple eschars may be present with regional lymphadenopathy .
Plasmodium vivax , an intacellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa .
It is estimated that 37 million people are infected worldwide , 97 % of them in Africa , and remaining in small foci in Central and South America and Yemen . Onchocerciasis was imported into Latin America by the slave trade . Onchocerciasis prevalence is related to the proximity to riverine breeding sites of black flies , with the highest disease burden in communities adjacent to rivers . Prevalence of infection rises with age until around 20 years , after which infection profiles vary between geographical region and sex . Higher rates of morbidity are reported in men . This variation canbe explainedby heterogeneity in age , gender , and occupational exposure to vectors .
Wild rodents -LRB- gerbils -RRB- that live in burrows together with sandfly vector . Hyraxes for L. aethiopica .
S. pneumoniae is an important cause of severe pneumonia , meningitis , and sepsis in children and adults . Risk factors for severe disease are : older age -LRB- > 65 years -RRB- , diabetes , chronic disease -LRB- heart , lung , kidney , liver -RRB- , alcoholism , cancer , HIV , non-functioning or absent spleen , and sickle cell disease . A global burden of disease study estimated that in 2000 about 14.5 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease occurred world wide , leading to about 826,000 deaths in children < 5 years . The most common presentation of severe disease is pneumonia . The majority of deaths -LRB- 95 % -RRB- occurred in Africa and Asia . Since 2000 the pneumococcal vaccine has been introduced , mostly in developed countries , while developing countries need themmost . In 2008 , 24 high-income and two middle-income countries had pneumococcal vaccination in their program , accounting for less than 0.2 % of childhood pneumococcal deaths in 2000 . Many deaths in low-income countries are due to poor healthcare infrastructure and inadequate treatment options . Penicillin and chloramphenicol are still widely used to treat meningitis despite high resistance levels against these agents in some areas . Vaccination and access to proper treatment are needed in Africa and Asia . Interventions should be targeted on countries with large populations and moderate incidence , and countries with high incidence and mortality .
Eastern equine encephalitis virus -LRB- EEEV -RRB- is an enveloped , single-stranded positive-sense RNA alphavirus , genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae , with four lineages : Eastern equine encephalitis virus -LRB- EEEV -RRB- is an enveloped , single-stranded positive-sense RNA alphavirus , genus
Mosquito-host-mosquito . The mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic reservoir host . Depending on ambient temperature , the virus reaches the salivary glands and is transmitted by feeding on the next host in several days .
For C. philippinensis : fish-eating birds . Freshwater fish are intermediate hosts .
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control ; disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas ; formalin-inactivated HTNV vaccines are used in Russia , China and Korea .
Approximately 15 to 20 million people worldwide are believed to be infected . In Africa all HTLV and STLV subtypes are found , and phylogenetic research suggest that HTLV-1 originated in Africa about 27,000 years ago . HTLV-1 infection is more common in women and the prevalence increases with age , with a peak incidence around age 50 . Among HTLV-1 carriers , the lifetime risk of developing HAM/TSP ranges from between 0.3 % and 4 % . For ATL , this risk is estimated to be 1 % to 5 % and for HTLV-1-associated diseases in general , including ATL , HAM/TSP , uveitis , polymyositis and arthropathy , the lifetime risk may be close to 10 % . Japan , Africa , Caribbean islands and South America are the areas of highest prevalence , but the reasons for this are unknown . Most infections world wide are due to subtype HTLV-1a . Distribution of the infection is focal , e.g. Brazil , Japan , and Iran , where HTLV-1 is limited to certain areas of each country . On several Japanese islands the prevalence can reach 37 % . Socioeconomic or genetic factors may contribute to the development of HTLV-associated infective dermatitis , since the disease has not been reported in HTLV-1 epidemic Japan . For non-endemic areas such as Europe and North America , HTLV-1 infection is mainly found in immigrants from endemic areas , their offspring and sexual contacts , among sex workers and IVDUs .
WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 . Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds . Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999 , WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world . Since the introduction to northeast America , the virus has spread to most regions in North America , Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and several cases in South America . The national average annual incidence of neuroinvasive disease in the USA during 1999 to 2008 was 0.40 per 100,000 population -LRB- range : 0.01 -- 1.02 -RRB- . In that time period in the USA , 28,961 cases were confirmed , including 1,131 deaths . Neuroinvasive disease incidence is higher among males , especially among persons aged 60 years . The highest incidence of neuroinvasive disease occurredin theWest Central and Mountain regions , probably resulting from the high efficiency of Cx . tarsalis as both an epizootic and epidemic WNV vector in those areas . Most US cases occur in the late summer , when Culex mosquitoes are more active and after WNV amplification in the bird reservoir . In warm climates year-round transmission is seen .
Group A rotaviruses have been established as the single most important cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in young children in developed and developing nations . Rotavirus is estimated to cause 138 million diarrheal episodes per year with 2 million requiring hospitalization and 440,000 deaths in children of < 5 years . The incidence of rotavirus disease is similar in developed and developing countries , but deaths mainly occur in poverty stricken nations due to poor health infrastructure . Control is likely not achieved by improvements in clean water access , hygiene , and sanitation . Rotavirus vaccines are recommended to prevent severe and fatal rotavirus disease . For vaccine introduction , knowledge of the regional circulating rotavirus serotypes is needed . The epidemiology of rotavirus serotypes has substantial temporal and geographic variability and multiple serotypes may cocirculate within the same region and fluctuates each year within the same region . The 5 most common rotavirus serotypes -LRB- G1 -- G4 and G9 -RRB- were responsible for approximately 95 % of infections world wide with G1 -LSB- P8 -RSB- responsible for more than 70 % of infections in North America , Australia , and Europe but only 30 % of infections in South America , Asia , and Africa .

Mild self-limiting dengue-like febrile illness , with headache , malaise , arthralgia , myalgia , nausea , vomiting , photophobia , maculopapular rash , and conjunctivitis . Other symptoms may include anorexia , diarrhea , constipation , and abdominal pain .
Bat to bat via unknown route . Humans and domestic animals are incidental hosts .
Ebola viruses , except RESTV , are endemic in the tropical rain forests of equatorial Africa . Most outbreaks started from a single case admitted to a hospital that had inadequate infection control , resulting in rapid nosocomial transmission . Cases have been imported from endemic countries into South Africa and Switzerland , and laboratory infections have occurred in the UK and Russia . Marburg viruses are endemic in arid woodlands of equatorial Africa . Outbreaks are usually limited to a few cases , with the exception of one outbreak in the DRC and Angola . Cases have been imported into South Africa , the Netherlands , and possibly the USA . A laboratory outbreak in 1967 in Germany and in Yugoslavia , led to the discovery of the disease -LRB- not shown on the map -RRB- .
Isolation of C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans by culture and toxigenicity testing of strains at reference labs .
Half of the infected patients are asymptomatic and those with symptoms usually have mild disease . The most common presentations of acute Q fever are pneumonia , hepatitis , and isolated fever . Other symptoms are neurological -LRB- headache , confusion , peripheral neuropathy -RRB- , sore throat , chills , sweats , rash , and non-productive cough . Proportion of people presenting with pneumonia or hepatitis varies by region and immune status . CFR : 1 -- 2 % . Chronic Q fever occurs 1 to 20 years after acute infection and most often presents as endocarditis in patients with pre-existing heart disease -LRB- valve abnormality -RRB- .
Tetanus is globally distributed but is more common in highly populated agricultural areas , and in warm and wet regions . In the late 1980s tetanus was estimated to cause around 1 million deaths per year , mostly in newborn infants . The current distribution of cases represents the coverage of tetanus immunization in children and adults . In countries with good vaccine coverage in children , adult cases may still be common , as natural immunity plays no role in the epidemiology of tetanus . The DTP3 Vaccination Coverage map shows coverage with the third dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine in childhood . The elimination of neonatal tetanus was set as a goal in 1989 and by mid2010 neonatal tetanus had been eliminated in 79 % -LRB- 153/193 -RRB- of WHO Member States . However , since C. tetani will always remain present in nature , tetanus will always remain a threat , and high levels of immunization must be maintained indefinitely .
The cestode Diphyllobothrium latum -LRB- fish or broad tapeworm -RRB- , the largest human tapeworm -LRB- up to 25 meters long -RRB- . In Japan and eastern Russia D. nihonkaiense is common . At least 13 other Diphyllobothrium species have been reported to infect humans , but less frequently .

Filarial nematode -LRB- roundworm -RRB- , Loa loa . Adult worms are nematodes that live freely in subcutaneous tissue . Adult females are 40 -- 70 mm long and males are 30 -- 34mm long .
Sanitation . Avoid eating uncooked water plants in endemic areas . Do not fertilize water plants for consumption with human or pig feces . Abandon practice of feeding water plants to pigs . Health education . The eggs can resist low temperatures and can be maintained at 4 C for 3 to 4 months ; they are killed at 50 C in 4 hours . Water can be chemically treated to kill the flukes .
Tularemia has six characteristic clinical syndromes , depending on the site of infection : ulceroglandular -LRB- commonest -RRB- , glandular , oropharyngeal , pneumonic , oculoglandular , and typhoidal . Clinical signs include sudden onset of high fever , chills , generalized aches , and chronic ulcer at the bite site -LRB- ulceroglandular -RRB- . From the primary site , lymphatic spread to regional lymphnodes . Further hematogeneous dissemination to other organs . CFR for Type A -LRB- ulcero -RRB- glandular disease is < 2 % if treated promptly -LRB- 5 to 30 % if not treated -RRB- . In the acute septic form -LRB- typhoidal -RRB- of the disease , lymphadenopathy and ulcer are absent , and the CFR is high -LRB- 30 -- 60 % -RRB- . Oculoglandular disease is rare . Ingestion of infected material may result in oropharyngeal or GI tularemia . In the oropharyngeal form signs are : throat pain , large tonsils , pseudomembrane , and enlarged cervical lymph nodes . Symptoms in GI tularemia range from mild persistent diarrhea to extensive intestinal ulcers and death . Pneumonic tularemia occurs after inhalation of bacteria , or secondary from other entry sites and may progress to severe pneumonia , respiratory failure , and death .
B. quintana multiplies in the louse 's intestine and is excreted in the feces . Body lice feed several times per day that leads to itchiness and scratching , by which the skin is inoculated with louses ' contaminated feces . Chronic B. quintana bacteremia facilitates infection in lice and further spread .
Spherical , enveloped , negative sense RNA viruses forming a subgroup of the Bunyaviridae family . In the Americas , human pathogens belonging to the group are Guaroa virus -LRB- GROV -RRB- , Jamestown Canyon virus -LRB- JCV -RRB- , LaCrosse virus -LRB- LACV -RRB- , and snowshoe hare virus -LRB- SSHV -RRB- . Those reported to cause human disease in Europe or Asia are Inkoo virus -LRB- INKV -RRB- , Tahyna virus -LRB- TAHV -RRB- , and SSHV .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment .
California encephalitis , Jamestown Canyon encephalitis , La Crosse encephalitis .
The vector becomes infected with OROV by feeding on a viremic host . The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the insect . After a few days , depending on the ambient temperature , the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding . Jungle cycle : OROV is transmitted among sloths , marsupials , primates , and birds by the mosquitoes Aedes serratus and Culex quinquefasciatus . Urban cycle : OROV is transmitted to humans by midges -LRB- Culicoides paraensis -RRB- .
Via tick bite . Or consumption of raw milk or dairy products from infected animals . For EUR , rarely , by blood transfusion and breast milk .
Vaccination with live attenuated virus vaccine should be routine for children -LRB- minimum age : 12 months -RRB- , preferably with the combined measles , mumps , and rubella vaccine -LRB- MMR -RRB- , with a booster at age 4 to 6 years . Infected children should be kept out of school and away from other child contacts . Displaced persons -LRB- e.g. refugees -RRB- should be vaccinated within a week of their arrival in a camp . For postexposure prophylaxis , vaccination is recommended within 72 hours of exposure , with a booster in 5 -- 6 weeks ; human immunoglobulin for immunocompromised persons and those for whom vaccine is contraindicated .
IgM serology on paired sera ; specific identification to subtype by virus isolation ; RT-PCR .
Soil , decaying vegetation .
Non-invasive GI listeriosis : fever , muscle aches , nausea and diarrhea . Invasive listeriosis : septicemia , meningoencephalitis , and perinatal listeriosis . Meningoencephalitis : headache , stiff neck -LRB- often absent -RRB- , confusion , convulsions and coma -LRB- CFR : 20 -- 30 % -RRB- . Infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage , stillbirth and infection of the newborn . Pregnant womenmost commonly haveflu-likesymptoms . Focalinfections in any organ may occur . Focal cutaneous and eye infections can occur after direct inoculation with contaminated tissue , usually occupational . Listerial gastroenteritis is uncommon .
Unknown .
Wild , migratory birds of the order Passeriformes -LRB- mainlyfieldfare , redwing , and songthrush -RRB- and Anseriformes -LRB- ducks , geese and swans -RRB- . Tetraonid birds -LRB- grouse -RRB- population size changes coincide with SINV epidemics in Finland . Larger passerine species have higher prevalences of infection as compared to smaller species .
SARS
Ixodid wood tick -LRB- Dermacentor andersoni -RRB- .
Through contact with infectious respiratory droplets or saliva .
HIV is transmitted through contact with HIVinfected body fluids -LRB- blood , semen , and vaginal secretions -RRB- and is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection . Other routes are : sharing contaminated needles ; mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy , childbirth and breastfeeding ; blood or blood product transfusion ; and organ or tissue transplantation .
Bilharziasis , Katayama fever or syndrome , urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis .
By bite of the vector .
Larval stage mites , so-called chiggers from the genus Leptotrombidium . A number of small rodents , particularly wild rats , are the natural hosts for scrub typhus without apparent disease .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment .
Undulant fever , malta fever , Mediterranean fever .
Oroya fever : penicillin , streptomycin , chloramphenicol and tetracyclines are all effective , with ampicillin for secondary infections , but the case may still evolve to verruga peruana , which is treatable with streptomycin or rifampicin . Severe cases : ceftriaxone iv is used and blood transfusion in case of severe anemia . Verruga peruana : rifampicin or streptomycin . B. bacilliformis is intrinsically resistant to quinolones .
Snails , slugs , and land planarians . The giant African snail , Achatina fulica , is the major source of infection world wide ; but has been replaced by the imported South American golden apple snail , Pomacea canaliculata , in Taiwan and mainland China .
