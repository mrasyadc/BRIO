There is an asexual phase in humans and a sexual phase in the vector mosquito.  The mosquito injects sporozoites that invade human liver cells where they reproduce and develop to merozoites, which, after release, infect erythrocytes.
RMSF cases are usually found in rural areas, and less commonly in urban areas. Residing in wooded regions or areas with high grass and exposure to dogs increases the risk of RMSF. RMSF is sporadic and rarely occurs in clusters.
RMSF in the USA follows a seasonal pattern with most cases in warmer months, when ticks are most active. RMSF cases are usually found in rural areas, and less commonly in urban areas. Residing in wooded regions or areas with high grass and exposure to dogs increases the risk of RMSF. RMSF is sporadic and rarely occurs in clusters.

The global number of hookworm disease cases is estimated to be 740 million individuals, with the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa and eastern Asia. the majority (85%) of the hookworm infections are caused by Necator americanus, which is the predominant hookworm of Latin America, the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia.

Junin virus is spread annually around harvest time by rodents to farmers. The range of Junin virus is extending to the north, putting an estimated 5 million people at risk. The other viruses are brought into villages and houses by peridomestic rodents, causing sporadic outbreaks with intervals of several years. Pathogenicity of Whitewater Arroyo virus remains to be confirmed since there was no virus isolation from the Californian cases.

The Americas were certified polio-free in 1994, the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and Europe in 2002 (in 2010, there was importation of polio into Europe). The GPEI has four main strategies to stop transmission of the wild poliovirus: (1) high infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in the first year of life; (2) supplementary doses of OPV to all children under 5 years of age during SIAs; (3) surveillance for wild poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases among children under 15 years of age; (4) targeted campaigns once wild poliovirus transmission is limited to a specific focal area.

SINV has been isolated from Africa, Eurasia, and Australia. The highest disease burden is in northern Europe (approximately between 60 and 64 N) and South Africa. Evolutionary studies show that SINV likely originated from South America, with subsequent spread to North America, Asia, and Australia, with later spread to Europe and Africa. Highest attack rates in Finland are in the eastern parts, and mainly in the age group 45 to 65 years. Epidemics tend to occur every 7 years in Finland, with the last epidemic in 2002.

Vaccination with live attenuated virus vaccine should be routine for children (minimum age: 12 months), preferably with the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), with a booster at age 4 to 6 years. Infected children should be kept out of school and away from other child contacts. Displaced persons (e.g. refugees) should be vaccinated within a week of their arrival in a camp.

The illness begins with a prodrome of fever, malaise, and headache followed by unilateral or, more commonly, bilateral tender swelling of the parotid (parotitis) or other salivary glands. Parotitis is present in 95% of clinical cases. Infection and inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) occurs in up to 30% of adult males but is rare before puberty. Orchitis results in testicular atrophy in 50% of cases but rarely causes sterility. Adult women may rarely suffer inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis). The commonest nervous system manifestation of mumps infection is meningitis. Other rarer clinical complications include hearing loss, encephalitis, and pancreatitis. Mumps infection in early pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.

In the absence of vaccination, Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5. Ten countries, all in Africa and Asia, accounted for an estimated 61% of all these Hib deaths.

Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, cases have decreased significantly. There were 1,292 reported cases in 2010, of which only 232 were in the endemic countries Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In endemic countries most cases are children aged <3 years. In 2009–2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to importation of the virus, notably hundreds of cases in Tajikistan. Most reported polio cases in 2010 (n 1,060) were in nonendemic countries. Polio transmission seems to have been reestablished in Chad, Angola, Sudan, and the DRC.

The highest incidences are recorded in Mediterranean countries, Middle East, Central America, and Central Asia. Many of the high-incidence countries were formerly part of the Soviet Union.

MPV is endemic in heavily forested areas of Africa, primarily of low altitude and high humidity. Comparison of active surveillance data in one health zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the 1980s (0.72 per 10,000) and 2006–2007 (14.5 per 10,000) suggests a 20-fold increase in human monkeypox incidence 30 years after mass smallpox vaccination ceased in that country. In 2003, multiple cases of monkeypox occurred across the USA among persons who had contact with the excretions of sick prairie dogs (native ground squirrels) either at a child-care center or from pet stores.

ONNV is a mutant of CHIKV that appeared in 1959 in Uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of Africa, leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic. There was a small outbreak in Côte d’Ivoire in 1984–1985 and again in 2003, also described as Igbo-Ora virus and a small recurrence in Uganda in 1996. Serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in Kenya in 1994–1995 and in horses in Nigeria, but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with CHIKV antibody.

In the UK, the primary epidemic has been associated with dietary exposure to BSE-infected bovine material during the BSE epidemic in the late 1980s to mid-1990s, before effective controls to prevent the BSE agent entering the human food supply were put into place. Most people who have developed vCJD have lived in or visited the UK during this time period.

Most people who have developed vCJD have lived in or visited the UK during this time period.

Eggs hatch in water and release miracidia larvae that penetrate the snail. the larvae pass through the intestinal wall into the peritoneal cavity, enter the liver, and lay eggs in the bile duct, which are then excreted in the feces.

Leprosy control is achieved by timely detection and treatment of new cases. BCG vaccination provides variable protection: from 34% to 80%.
Leprosy control is achieved by timely detection and treatment of new cases. leprae bacilli remain viable for 9 days in dried nasal secretions and about 6 weeks in moist soil.
After ingestion, the virus infects hepatocytes, resulting in periportal necrosis. The virus is shed via bile into the stool and contaminates the environment, leading to new infections in susceptible exposed individuals.

The disease is seasonal, generally coinciding with tick activity; there are peaks of incidence every 5–7 years in China. Europe and Russia have an estimated 12,000 cases per year (2007). In eastern regions the disease coincides with tick habitat in cold, moist forest, but tick ranges extend well beyond reported disease at both eastern and western geographical extremes.

WEEV was first isolated during an equine epizootic in California in 1930. Eight years later WEEV was isolated from a fatal humanWEE case in California. TheWEEV distribution is limited to the Americas with human epidemics occurring in North America west of the Mississippi river and Brazil.
