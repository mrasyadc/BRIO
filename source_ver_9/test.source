WHO recommends vaccination of all newborns. In countries where prevalence is low: WHO recommends vaccination of all newborns.
Human buccal flora.
Japanese B encephalitis.
Principally birds, secondarily rabbits, poultry.
HIV was first recognized clinically in 1981. As of 2009, over 25 million people are estimated to have died from HIV and around 33 million people are living with HIV. HIV epidemics are categorized into ‘low-level’ (HIV prevalence <1% in the general population and <5% in vulnerable group such as MSM, injecting drug users, sex workers); ‘concentrated’ (HIV prevalence <1% in the general population but > 5% in at least one vulnerable group); and ‘generalized’ (HIV prevalence > 1% in the general population). The greatest burden of HIV continues to fall on Sub-Saharan Africa, with 68% of all people living with HIV and 72% of all HIV-related deaths in 2009. The epidemic in Africa is, however, heterogeneous, with high-prevalence generalized epidemics in Southern African countries; generalized but moderate prevalence epidemics in Central, East and West Africa, and low-level epidemics in North Africa. No countries in Asia have a generalized epidemic. HIV-1 can be divided in four groups (M, O, N, and P). Over 90% of HIV-1 infections are group M and the map opposite shows the distribution of the 9 subtypes (clades) and recombinants of the M group HIV-1 viruses.
WHO estimates that 50,000 to 70,000 people are infected each year, with about 60 million people at risk in 36 countries. The disease distribution is limited by the range of the tsetse fly vector. Cases outside the tsetse fly distribution are likely imported. The disease distribution is patchy, with discrete foci and little to no disease between these foci. It is a disease of poverty and mainly occurs in remote rural areas. African trypanosomiasis was close to eradication through a variety of control programs, a loosening of these control programs caused the disease to reemerge in the 1980s. However, recent disease control programs are reversing this trend. The chronic gambiense form in West and Central Africa accounts for 95% of cases and is seperated from rhodesiense by the Great Rift Valley. Uganda is the sole country reporting both forms, with rhodesiense in the south and gambiense in the northwest.
Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) using reduced osmolarity ORS; intravenous rehydration in severe cases. Antibiotics are only useful to prevent spread, as they do not affect the already released toxin.
Kala-azar (Hindi for black sickness), black disease, dum-dum fever.
Coccidioides immitis (Californian) and C. posadasii (nonCalifornian), dimorphic, soil-borne, ascomycete fungi unique to the western hemisphere.
Wild rodents (gerbils) that live in burrows together with sandfly vector. Hyraxes for L. aethiopica.
Leishmania species, protozoa, members of the Trypanosomatidae family, order Kinetoplastida. Leishmania species that cause CL in the old world are: Leishmania major, L. tropica, and L. aethiopica. L. killicki is synonymous to L. tropica. L. infantum/chagasi and L. donovani can cause both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. L. chagasi is considered the same species as L. infantum, and are referred to as L. infantum/chagasi.
Forest rodents, marsupials, and bats.
Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. Generally, treatment is continued for at least 3 days after the patient is afebrile.
Inhalation of arthroconidia (reproductive spores) from the environment or dusty fomites. Sometimes through direct inoculation or transplantation. Person-to-person transmission is extremely rare.
Treatment of uncomplicated B. quintana bacteremia is with a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin) or doxycyclin. In case of endocarditis 4–6 months of therapy is recommended in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin or gentamicin for the first 2–3 weeks. Heart valve replacement may be needed.
Minute hard ticks: Ixodes ricinus in Eurasia, possibly Hemaphysalis longicornisin Korea, I. ovatusin Japan. I. scapularis (formerly I. dammini) in eastern North America, possibly I. dentatus in the central USA, I. pacificus in California and Washington state, USA.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a Gram-positive, aerobic rod that is classified into three potentially toxigenic biotypes, intermedius, mitis, and gravis. Toxin producing strains of C. diphtheriae carry a bacteriophage-derived tox gene. Toxinproducing strains of C. ulcerans may also cause respiratory diphtheria.
The 17D live, attenuated vaccine is protective after 10 days; revaccination is recommended every 10 years. Anti-mosquito precautions. Prevent infected individuals from mosquito exposure to break the transmission cycle.
Lice become infective 4–5 days after an infectious blood meal and remain so for life (20–30 days). Infected ticks remain infective for life (in excess of 10 years).
Leptospira chronically colonize the proximal renal tubules of many animals and are excreted in the urine into the environment. Animals can shed Leptospira into the environment for prolonged periods without any signs of disease.
Bartonella quintana (formerly Rochalimaea quintana and Rickettsia quintana), a fastidious intracellular Gram-negative bacterium.
About 60% of exposures result in asymptomatic infection. Symptoms range from benign pulmonary infection (fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea), night sweats, anorexia and weight loss to progressive pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease involving skin, bones and/or joints, the central nervous system, and other organ systems. Most patients with primary disease recover spontaneously and have life-long immunity to re-infection. Chronic and disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to 5% of cases. Meningeal infection occurs in less than 1% of extrapulmonary cases and requires life-long treatment.
Plasmodium falciparum, an intracellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa. Among the malaria parasites, P. falciparum causes the vast majority of mortality.
Among those infected, about 20% develop acute watery diarrhea, of which 10–20% develop severe watery diarrhea with vomiting, leading to severe dehydration which may be lethal if not treated. The CFR is typically below 5%, but in crowded refugee camps it can run as high as 50%.
Hookworm eggs hatch in the soil and develop to infective larvae (L3) that can penetrate the skin. After entering the host, the larvae migrate to the lungs, move up the trachea and swallowed. In the gastrointestinal tract the larvae mature to adult worms (both sexes). After mating, the female hookworms produce up to 30,000 eggs per day that are shedded with the stools into the environment.
Polysaccharide vaccines against A, C, Y, and W135 are available. These vaccines are safe and effective in adults and older children but are poorly immunogenic in children under the age of 2 and the duration of protection is limited to 3–5 years. The development of a group C conjugated meningococcal vaccine that is effective in children under the age of 2 years has been an important advance, and conjugate vaccines are now available for A, C, Y, and W135. The development of a group B vaccine remains a challenge. Chemoprophylaxis of close contacts eradicates carriage and reduces the incidence of secondary cases. Vaccination of household contacts may also prevent further cases.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment. Aspirin should be avoided.
Direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets.
Humans are the definitive host; pigs are an intermediate host.
Removal of breeding sites in any type of container that holds water (e.g. vase, tire). Larviciding standing water, adulticiding with non-persistent insecticides. Personal protection with suitable clothing, mosquito repellents, nets, and screens.
TB is a major cause of death and disability world wide, especially in developing countries. Morbidity and mortality rates increase with age, and are higher in males. In regions of high incidence, morbidity peaks in adults of working age. Morbidity is higher in urban populations, among the poor, and in closed institutions such as prisons and military barracks. There were an estimated 9.27 million incident cases of TB in the world in 2007 (14% HIV positive), an almost 50% increase from 1990, and an estimated onethird of the world’s population is either latently or actively infected with TB. Most of the cases in 2007 were in Asia (55%) and Africa (31%). MDR-TB is a serious problem in Russia, former Russian republics, India and China. In 2007 there were an estimated 0.5 million MDR-TB cases. By 2008, 55 countries reported at least one XDR-TB case.
Boutonneuse fever (group name for R.conorii infections: MSF, ISF, ITT), QTT and STT/NATT: mild febrile illness that may last up to 2 weeks, eschar at bite site with regional lymphadenopathy (in ISF, eschars are rare), generalized maculopapular erythematous rash on palms on soles after 4–5 days. The disease can be severe with a CFR up to 3%. ATBF is milder than other rickettsioses, fever and rash are less common, multiple eschars may be present with regional lymphadenopathy.
By mosquito bite. There is no direct person-toperson transmission documented, and no evidence of congenital transmission.
Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and B. timori, threadlike nematode worms 80 to 100 mm long (W. bancrofti), or 43 to 55 mm long (B. malayi).
Brucella melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, intracellular Gram-negative bacilli.
By mosquito bite (Anopheles spp.). Transmission has been described in needle sharing IVDUs and through blood transfusion.
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an enveloped, spherical, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. Epizootic or epidemic VEE viruses belong to subtypes IAB and IC. Enzootic VEE complex viruses belong to subtypes II to VI and ID, IE, and IF.With the exception of IE strains, these do not cause disease in equids, but can cause sporadic disease in humans. VEEV is considered a potential biological warfare agent.
N. meningitidis is transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets.
Systemic treatment to prevent dissemination with pentavalent antimonials. Depending on the infecting Leishmania species, alternative systemic treatment can be administered with: amphotericin B, pentamidine, or miltefosine. Topical treatment options are: paramomycin, ketoconazole, and thermotherapy.
Mainly humans; yaws is also found in non-human primates (baboons, chimpanzees, and gorillas).
Vector control; mosquito repellent; insecticidetreated bed nets; residual spraying of insecticides; treatment of infected humans. Recently control measures are being upscaled in a malaria elimination effort. Morocco, United Arab Emirates, and Turkmenistan have been certified malaria free by WHO.
Pestis, pest, bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, black plague, black death.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Depends on portal of entry. The skin lesion is a characteristic black eschar surrounded by edema, usually on the head, forearms or hands, accompanied by malaise and fever, in 80% of cases resolving spontaneously after 7–10 days, but if left untreated it may evolve into fatal septicemia. GI anthrax produces nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, hematemesis, occasionally bloody diarrhea and often fatal septicemia and shock. Inhalation anthrax is rapidly progressive and starts with fever, malaise and mild cough and chest pain, evolving to acute respiratory distress, diagnostic mediastinal widening, cyanosis and shock. Untreated cutaneous anthrax has a CFR of 5–20% (<1% with treatment), GI anthrax 25–60%, and inhalation anthrax 100% (75% with treatment).
Mycobacterium ulcerans, an acid-fast, slow-growing bacillus. There are at least four geographically distinct strains: African, American, Asian, and Australian. They all produce mycolactone, which destroys tissue and suppresses the immune system. Variations in the structure of mycolactone may correlate with disease severity in different regions.
In Africa, isolated from Aedes africanus, Ae. apicoargenteus, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. aegypti, Ae. vittatus, and Ae. furcifer mosquitoes; probably Ae. hensilii on Yap island.
The disease ecology is not completely understood. Humans are likely dead end hosts.
Protection from vector bites by wearing permethrin-treated light-colored clothes and fly repellent on exposed skin. DEC can be used as prophylaxis, but should not be used routinely.
Detection of toxin in serum, stool or wound by mouse inoculation or ELISA; culture of the bacterium from stool or wound; electromyography.
Poliovirus, an RNA enterovirus with three types; type 1 cases are most common, followed by type 3; wild type 2 disappeared in 1999. Rare cases of all three types occur in unimmunized contacts of children vaccinated with the Sabin live attenuated vaccine.
Clean wounds, perform debridement and remove foreign objects. A one-off dose of im or iv human tetanus immunoglobulin removes unbound toxin but does not affect bound toxin. Metronidazole in large doses for 7–14 days to eradicate C. tetani infection. Since the effect of bound toxin may last for 4–6 weeks, prolonged supportive care is required. Tetanus does not induce immunity. Vaccination with tetanus toxoid is therefore indicated during treatment.
90% of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic; 10% develop invasive-intestinal disease (colitis), and <1% extra-intestinal disease (liver abscess). Amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps, weight loss, and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea; most patients are afebrile. Amebic colitis rarely progresses to necrotizing colitis, ameboma, and toxic megacolon. Amebic colitis affects children and adults equally, but mainly males. Amebic liver-abscess mainly occurs in men aged 18 to 50 years, for unknown reasons. E. moshkovskii can cause non-invasive diarrhea.
WHO (2010) estimates that there are over 120 million infections world wide, with 40 million patients incapacitated or disfigured by the disease, principally in India and Sub Saharan Africa. 90% of the infections are due to W. bancrofti. Chronic manifestations mainly occur in the elderly. About 27 million have hydrocele (men) and 16 million have lymphedema or elephantiasis of theleg (mostly women). Asia and South America have lower Bancroftian filariasis prevalences (below 8%) than Sub Saharan Africa (up to 37%) and Pacific Island (up to 48%) regions. Within areas of low prevalence, pockets of high prevalence may exist (e.g. Reciffe, Brazil). In the Americas there is only active transmission in four countries and mainly affects the poor and slum inhabitants. China has been declared non-endemic for lymphatic filariasis since 2007 and Korea in 2008, achieved by extensive control efforts. The vectors are still present and therefore there remains a risk of re-emergence.
By tsetse fly bite (day biters); blood transfusion, and congenital.
The impact of sanitation, footwear, and health education is minimal. To reduce the disease burden of STHs, mass treatment campaigns with benzimidazoles and praziquantel are undertaken, and sanitation and access to clean water improved. As most STHs occur in children, control efforts are targeted at schools. Infective larvae can survive in soil for several months.
Rats (Rattus, particularly R. norvegicus and Bandicotta spp.). Infected dogs, wild mammals, and marsupials have been found, but do not contribute to the spread of the disease.
By mosquito bite. There is no person-toperson transmission.
Fecal–oral route, mainly via fecally contaminated water, but also via: food, materno-fetal, and transfusion of blood products. Direct person-to-person transmission is uncommon. Cycle: Human to human and occasionally animal to human. HEV is excreted from the liver into the stool via the bile and eventually into the environment. The amount of infectious virus in the stool is relatively low and explains a lower rate of transmission as compared to hepatitis A (see Hepatitis A map).
Chikungunya means ‘that which bends up’ in Makonde language, to describe the pain.
Humans.
HBV disease has an acute and chronic form. 10% of children and 30–50% of adults present with symptoms of acute HBV infection similar to hepatitis A and last several weeks: fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, jaundice, dark urine, and light stools. Fever is often absent and arthritis and rash may be present. Chronic disease evolves to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma and eventually death. 90% of infants who are infected in their first year develop chronic infection. Only 10% of adults who acquire infection develop chronic disease, as the majority is able to clear HBV within 6 months. Differences in disease severity, risk of liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma are seen by age of infection, level of viral replication, level of inflammation, region and HBV genotype. Also co-infection with HDV leads to more severe chronic liver disease.
Enteric fever, typhus abdominalis.
Monkeys, possibly rodents.
Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), a type C retrovirus with at least 6 subtypes. The virus was isolated for the first time in the USA in 1980, before HIV-1 (also a retrovirus) was discovered in 1983. Genomically, simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) isolates cluster closely with HTLV-1 in the same region, suggesting simian-to-human transmission at multiple occasions.
Rodent to rodent with spill over to humans in case of adequate exposure.
Respiratory droplets from people with respiratory diptheria, or from asyumptomatic throat or nasal carriers. Direct contact with discharge from the skin of cutaneous diphteria cases. People recovering from diphtheria may carry the organism in the nasopharynx for weeks. Rarely from contaminated items. In the past, outbreaks have been linked to consumption of contaminated raw milk.
Direct transmission via skin to skin or oral contact (also via sharing drinking and eating utensils). Sharing of drinking vessels plays an important role in transmission of endemic syphilis in arid regions. There is little or no mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy.
Most infections produce few or no symptoms. Acute symptoms include variable fever, lymphadenopathy,malaise, and hepatosplenomegaly. The entry site may be inflamed for up to 8 weeks, and a diagnostic unilateral bipalpebral edema (Romana’s sign) appears in a few cases. After a latent period which may last 10–30 years, chronic irreversible sequelae occur in 20–30% of cases: myocardial lesions with arrhythmia, often fatal, andlesions of the esophagus, colon, and peripheral nervous system. Variations in clinical presentations can be related to the strain involved. Group I T. cruzi, rare north of the Amazon region, produce cardiac but not digestive tract lesions. Group IIT. cruzi can produce both cardiac and digestive tract lesions. AIDS patients may develop meningoencephalopathy. CFR from encephalomyelitis or cardiac failure among untreated symptomatic patients is 5–10%.
For mild cases, an oral triazole; for severe cases, amphotericin B followed by an oral triazole for at least a year.
Bite of infected larval mites (chiggers). There is no direct person-to-person transmission.
Blister,usually on the leg or foot,which burns or itches, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, dizziness and generalized urticaria. Multiple and repeat infections occur, there is no protective immunity. Painful and infected ulcers can incapacitate patients for months. Secondary bacterial infection can lead to abscesses, synovitis, ankylosis andlimbcontractures, septic arthritis, and life-threatening sepsis.
Praziquantel; the cure rate for O. viverrini is over 90%.
Supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation. There is no specific treatment, but ribavirin may have some effect. Monoclonal antibodies as post-exposure prophylaxis before onset of clinical signs.
Valley fever, San Joaquin fever, Desert fever, Desert rheumatism, California disease.
During outbreaks: strict control on animal movements and slaughtering; health education of everyone who butchers, prepares, and cooks pork, including in their homes; wearing gloves to handle raw or uncooked pork, careful washing of hands and utensils. Adequate cooking essential; WHO recommends cooking pork to reach an internal temperature of 70 C, or until the juices are clear rather than pink.
During bloodmeal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.
By mosquito bite. There is no direct person-toperson transmission.
Salmonella enterica enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), a Gram-negative bacillus. S. Typhi belongs to Salmonella serogroup D and possesses somatic antigen O9, a single flagellar antigen Hd, and virulence antigen Vi. S. Paratyphi A can cause similar disease.
Visualizing characteristic eggs in feces or duodenal fluid by microscopy.
None.
Immunocompromised, asplenic, and elderly people are at higher risk of symptomatic disease. The number of cases diagnosed in the USA has increased markedly since 1975 due to an increase in the white-tailed deer population, hosts of the adult vector ticks. Nearly all patients with Babesia divergens infection in Europe had been splenectomized and exposed to cattle. The B. divergens-like parasite in the USA has a reservoir in cottontail rabbits, and is not infectious for cattle; it has been found in only 3 patients. All 3 patients with B. venatorum (EU1) infection had also been splenectomized. Cape Verdean, Egyptian, and Asian cases lie outside the range of Ixodes ricinus; B. duncani and B. divergens-like cases in west coast states of USA lie outside the range of I. scapularis. Possible vectors for these cases are I. dentatus in the central USA, and I. pacificus on the west coast. Infection is seasonal (summer), coinciding with abundance of nymphal ticks in warmer months.
Microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito, and develop in 2 weeks into larvae that enter the mouth-parts. Larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed. In humans, they travel via thelymphatics, when adults they form ‘nests’ and produce microfilariae, which migrate to the blood and display periodicity coinciding with the peak vector biting times.
South American blastomycosis, Brazilian blastomycosis, Lutz–Splendore–Almeida disease.
Anti-mosquito measures: light-colored clothing with long sleeves mosquito repellents containing DEET on exposed skin, avoid as much as possible outdoor activities at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active, and removal of mosquito-breeding sites from around the home.
Serology (IF, EIA); PCR; culture in mice or cell lines.
Trematode worms Schistosoma japonicum, S. malayensis, and S. mekongi.
Most infections with S. stercoralis are asymptomatic. Symptoms may include: upper abdominal pain; cough; diarrhea; a red and painful, creeping urticarial eruption on the skin; and vomiting. Pulmonary symptoms (including Loeffler syndrome) can occur. Disseminated strongyloidiasis occurs in immunocompromised patients and presents with abdominal pain, distension, shock, pulmonary and neurologic complications, and septicemia. High mortality rates (15–87%) have been described in patients with disseminated disease.
Humans; forest monkeys in West Africa and Southeast Asia.
RT-PCR on whole blood or serum; virus isolation; plaque reduction neutralization test (there is crossreactivity with related viruses, including CHIKV).
Supportive.
Alveolar or multilocular echinococcosis.
Eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies, mature in about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on water temperature, and hatch ciliated larvae (coracidia). Coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans (copepods). The copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host, typically small fish. The larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae. Larger predator fish (e.g. pike, burbot, perch) ingest the smaller infected fish upon which the plerocercoid larvae migrate to the flesh of these larger fish that serve as third intermediate hosts harboring larvae. Humans and larger mammals acquire the disease by eating these larger fish raw or undercooked. The larvae mature into adult tapeworms that attach to the small intestinal wall by scolex and develop eggfilled proglottids that detach. Up to 1 million eggs per day per worm are passed in the feces, 2–6 weeks after infection.
SARS presents initially with fever, headache, myalgia, and a non-productive cough that may progress to dyspnoea with pulmonary infiltrations on chest x-ray. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present in early SARS illness. Case fatality is around 10%, and is higher in older adults than in children and young adults.
Direct examination of blood smear (low sensitivity), PCR, serology (indirect immunofluorescence, indirect hemagglutination). Serology can give false positive results. Culture takes weeks.
In the early 20th century diphtheria was the leading cause of death in children aged 4–10 years in Europe, and many countries experienced large diphtheria outbreaks during World War II. Childhood vaccination has now virtually eliminated diphtheria as a public health problem in most developed countries, and diphtheria cases reported to WHO have fallen by almost 93% between 1980 and 2008. The WHO has estimated that around 5,000 deaths from diphtheria occurred in 2004, with 4,000 of these in children under 5 years of age. However, a steady decline in the global number of reported diphtheria cases from 1980 was interrupted by a large recrudescence in the early to mid-1990s in the former Soviet Union. Since 1990, diphtheria outbreaks have also occurred in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and South America. Without periodic immunological boosting through vaccination or natural exposure to toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae, adults may become susceptible to infection. Epidemics may then occur, exacerbated by poor living conditions or the emergence of new toxigenic variants. This has led to the introduction of booster doses of toxoid in adolescents in some non-endemic countries.
Virus detection in blood or tissue by culture or RT-PCR; serology (IgM ELISA, IFA). Virus isolation should be done in a BSL-4 laboratory.
Undulant fever, malta fever, Mediterranean fever.
Virus detection by RT-PCR of respiratory specimens is recommended; virus culture requires a BSL-3 facility. Microneutralization assay is recommended to detect antibodies to A/H5N1. Rapid antigen tests are not recommended due to lack of sensitivity.
Avoid eating raw slugs, snails, other molluscs, freshwater prawns, land crabs, and uncooked vegetables grown in ponds (e.g. watercress) from endemic areas.Washing of vegetables does not guarantee absence from larval contamination. Boil snails and crustaceans for 5 minutes or freeze at 15 C for 24 hours.
Gram stain and culture of CSF, blood, or synovial fluid. Capsular polysaccharide antigen detection by latex agglutination or other techniques. PCR from normally sterile site.
A zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii, an intracellular Gram-negative bacterium, and is closely related to Legionella spp., Francisella tularensis, and Rickettsia spp. C. burnetii is classified as a potential biological warfare agent.
O. viverrini: usually asymptomatic. Occasionally abdominal pain, flatulence, fatigue, mild hepatomegaly, jaundice, and cholangitis. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most serious complication. O. felineus: fever and hepatitis-like symptoms in the acute stage (right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis). Chronic symptoms: biliary tract obstruction, inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tract, liver abscesses, pancreatitis, and suppurative cholangitis.
Hantaviruses, a large group of different, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense viruses with a tripartite RNA genome, that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. Hantaviruses are named after the Hantan River area in South Korea, where the first hantavirus (Hantaan) was isolated in the 1970s. Old World and New World hantaviruses share high similarity in their genome and have comparable life cycles. Currently, there is no consensus on the classification of hantaviruses. Old World hantaviruses shown on the map are: Dobrava–Belgrade virus (DOBV), Hantaan virus (HTNV), Puumula virus (PUUV), and Saaremaa virus (SAAV). Seoul virus (SEOV) is not shown, it is world wide in major port cities.
Hemorrhagic fever, jungle yellow fever, urban yellow fever.
Zika virus, an enveloped RNA flavivirus; closely related to Spondweni virus.
Ziehl–Neelsen stain on smears or biopsies, culture (takes 6–12 weeks), PCR, histopathology.
Serology (HEV IgM, IgG); HEV RNA detection in blood and stool by RT-PCR.
Secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole. HIV patients with low CD4 counts should avoid endemic areas.
Human-deer-fly-human. After infectivelarvae enter the wound they migrate and develop into adult worms in subcutaneous tissue. Adult worms produce microfilariae, that circulate in the peripheral blood in daytime and can be taken up by the next fly during feeding. In the fly they develop into larvae in 10–12 days and enter the proboscis, and the cycle repeats. An infected human can remain infectious to the vector for up to 15 years. Transmission is facilitated by the fact that microfilaremia and the vector-biting activity occur in daytime.
Loa loa filariasis, loiasis, African eyeworm, Calabar swelling
Fever and signs of meningitis (headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, intolerance of light, and decreased level of consciousness). Hearing loss, generally permanent, in around 50% of those infected. Arthritis, pneumonia, and fatal toxic shock syndrome are possible complications.
Detection of viral RNA in blood by RTPCR; serology (IgM ELISA); virus culture.
Streptomycin is recommended, with gentamicin as an alternative. Tetracyclines may be used for less severe cases.
Group A rotaviruses have been established as the single most important cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in young children in developed and developing nations. Rotavirus is estimated to cause 138 million diarrheal episodes per year with 2 million requiring hospitalization and 440,000 deaths in children of <5 years. The incidence of rotavirus disease is similar in developed and developing countries, but deaths mainly occur in poverty stricken nations due to poor health infrastructure. Control is likely not achieved by improvements in clean water access, hygiene, and sanitation. Rotavirus vaccines are recommended to prevent severe and fatal rotavirus disease. For vaccine introduction, knowledge of the regional circulating rotavirus serotypes is needed. The epidemiology of rotavirus serotypes has substantial temporal and geographic variability and multiple serotypes may cocirculate within the same region and fluctuates each year within the same region. The 5 most common rotavirus serotypes (G1–G4 and G9) were responsible for approximately 95% of infections world wide with G1[P8] responsible for more than 70% of infections in North America, Australia, and Europe but only 30% of infections in South America, Asia, and Africa.
Lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis and laboratory testing is supportive. ELISA or IFA, confirmed by IgM and IgG Western or striped blot test. PCR on blood, CSF, urine and tissues, but is not standardized.
