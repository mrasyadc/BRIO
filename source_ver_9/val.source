Supportive, there is no specific polio treatment.
TBE, Western, European or Central European tick-borne encephalitis, Siberian tick-borne encephalitis, Far Eastern tick-borne encephalitis (formerly known as Russian Spring Summer encephalitis), diphasic milk fever, diphasic meningoencephalitis
S. stercoralis has a free-living (asexual) and parasitic (sexual) lifecycle. Free-living filariform (L3) larvae in the soil penetrate the skin, enter the bloodstream, reach the lungs, travel up to the throat, and are swallowed. In the duododenal wall they mature into adult female worms, produce eggs that hatch immediately, thus only larvae (L1) are excreted. These non-infectious (L1) larvae develop further in the soil into either adult worms or infectious (L3) larvae. Some non-infectious L1 larvae may develop faster into infectious L3 larvae in the human intestine and penetrate the perianal skin or colon wall. This process of auto-infection may lead to hyperinfection in immunocompromised individuals.
Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA alphavirus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, with four lineages: Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA alphavirus, genus
Before 2004, CHIKV was considered a minor arboviral disease, but since then has spread globally, infecting millions of people. Most cases are symptomatic. CHIKV has been endemic in Africa for centuries, typically causing small epidemics in rural areas. CHIKV spread to Asia within the last 60 years producing urban outbreaks, similar to dengue fever, involving Ae. egypti. The global epidemic started since a mutation in the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein gene (A226V) occurred, that enhanced its infectivity and transmission by Ae. albopictus. The mutated CHIKV is succesful in spreading in tropical and temperate regions where Ae. albopictus is present. In 2005–2006 CHIKV spread from East Africa to virgin soil in the Indian Ocean Islands to produce epidemics affecting up to three-quarters of the population. Since 2006, CHIKV outbreaks with are reported from several (sub)tropical countries in the new world. CHIKV virus was imported into several European countries and caused a small outbreak with autochthonous transmission in northern Italy. CHIKV-viremic travelers can cause autochthonous transmission in previous CHIKV-free areas if Ae. albopictus or other competent mosquitoes are present.
Demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in Giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy; PCR tests have been developed for the different Leishmania species; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience. The Montenegro skin test is simple, sensitive and specific, but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections.
Probably non-human primates; the virus has been isolated from monkeys in Panama and French Guiana, also in the USA from a north-bound migratory bird. Antibody has been found in domestic animals and other vertebrates.
Tabanid and Stomoxys flies and mosquitoes can transmit, but are not epizootic vectors. Blow-flies can also spread the bacteria.
Dengue-like acute febrile illness with chills, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia and severe arthralgia of the small joints of the hands and feet, sometimes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, painful lymphadenopathies and often a maculopapular rash. Arthralgias may persist for months, but no fatalities have been recorded.
Sudden onset fever, frontal headache, backache, diarrhea and a rash; usually resolves without sequelae; fatalities are rare and the result of hemorrhage or meningoencephalitis. ILEV and NRIV can cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. CVV rarely causes encephalitis, with only one fatal case reported in the USA in 1995.
Aquatic insects; in southern Australia mosquitoes; not yet fully understood.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Rodent-to-rodent though saliva, excreta and bite, with humans as an accidental, dead-end host.
The blood-feeding nematodes Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). A. ceylanicum has a limited distribution. The adult nematodes are up to 10mm long.
Serology or RT-PCR on blood or CSF; virus isolation.
Ancylostomiasis, Necatoriasis, Uncinariasis, ground itch.
Hendra virus disease, Nipah virus disease.
Microscopic identification of eggs in the stool, visualization of proglottids passed in the stool.
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa, where it is estimated that 12–13 million humans are infected. The prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age, and is more common in men as they are more exposed. Loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control. It has been proposed that areas where the Loiasis prevalence is > 20%, are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment.
Sudden onset fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, severe abdominal or lower back pain, often with nausea and vomiting, followed by hypotension which may progress to shock, hemorrhages and renal involvement, and death. Convalescence is prolonged. PUUV virus causes less severe disease. The CFR is 5–15% for HFRS; for PUUV and SAAV infection the CFR is 1%; for DOBV the CFR is 9–12%. The differential diagnosis is leptospirosis or rickettsioses.
Main transmission is fecal–oral, but houseflies act as supplementary vectors by contaminating food after feeding on exposed human feces.
Unknown. It has been proposed that bamboo rats may amplify infectious dispersal stages for human infections.
None
The disease is self-limiting and acute symptoms are similar to acute hepatitis A disease. Children are generally asymptomatic or have mild disease. Clinical evident disease is more common in age group 15–44 years, with following symptoms: fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, and light stool. Pregnant women are at risk for severe disease, including fulminant hepatitis and death. In immunocompromised persons (e.g. transplant recipients or users of immune-modulating therapy) chronic infection has been reported.
Serology (IFA on acute and convalescent serum); cross-reactivity occurs. Microscopy of blood or bone marrow smears is insensitive; PCR on acute phase whole blood; isolation by cell culture in reference labs.
The vector defecates during feeding, and the infected feces are rubbed into the bite wound or conjunctivae, mucousmembranes, or abraded skin; blood transfusion, organ transplant and shared needles. Congenital infection occurs in 2–8% of infected pregnancies. Oral transmission occurs by eating or drinking contaminated food or drink.
HFRS is caused by Myodes-, Rattus-, and Apodemusborne hantaviruses. Each virus has its particular host: Apodemus spp. (striped field mouse) for HTNV, DOBV and SAAV and Myodes ( Clethrionomys) for PUUV. SEOV infects Rattus norvegicus and can therefore be found world wide.
Mainly humans; rarely domestic animals. Humans can be short-term carriers after an infection (10%) or become chronic carriers in the biliary tract (1–5%), shedding viable bacteria in the stool. Chronic carriers are mainly adults with pre-existingbiliary tractpathology.Urinary carriagemay occur in areas where Schistosoma haematobium is endemic.
Tsutsugamushi disease, miteborne typhus fever, chigger-borne rickettsioses, coastal fever (Australia).
Adult worm can be extracted by carefully and slowly winding the worm around a stick over a period of days. Metronidazole or thiabendazole can facilitate the extraction process, but should be used with caution.
By tick bite, blood transfusion; bone marrow for transplantation is routinely screened in endemic areas.
Intestinal capillariasis, Pudoc mystery disease, wasting disease.
Tick-small mammals and birds-tick; large mammals are necessary to maintain tick populations. Humans and lizards are dead-end hosts.
Infection may be asymptomatic or progressive and fatal, if untreated. Onset is often insidious. Common symptoms include fever, malaise, weight loss, and sweats. Cough may be prominent. Symptoms can come and go. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are common findings. HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk for symptomatic infection. Bacterial co-infections, including tuberculosis, may occur. Anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory findings.
Intestinal capillariasis is generally found in countries where raw freshwater fish is eaten. The parasite was first reported in 1963 in the northern Philippines. C. philippinensisis endemic in the Philippines, Laos, and Thailand. Rare cases have been reported from other Asian countries and the Middle East. A single case has been reported in Spain imported from Colombia, but there are no other reports of cases in the Americas. Rare cases of human infection with C. hepatica and C. aerophila have been reportedworldwide. Infected fishmay be exported from endemic areas to non-endemic countries.
Rodent–rodent, with humans as accidental dead-end hosts. Infected reservoir hosts are asymptomatic and excrete infectious virus in the urine.
For W. bancrofti: Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles spp., and Aedes spp. in the Pacific Islands; for B. malayi: Mansonia, Anopheles, and Aedes; for B. timori, An. barbirostris. Anopheles spp. transmit parasites less efficiently than Culex spp., and Culex spp. are more abundant in urban settings.
Cat liver fluke disease, foodborne trematodiasis
Human.
It is estimated that over one million cases of scrub typhus occur each year. Infections most often occur in rural areas where diagnostic facilities are limited. Scrub typhus is thought to occur within the so-called ‘Scrub typhus triangle,’ bounded by Siberia (north), Kamchatka Peninsula (east), Pakistan (west), and Australia (south). O. tsutsugamushi infection primarily occurs in tropical climate in Asia, but is also found in temperate zones and semi-arid climates, including in scrub, gardens, forests, beach areas, and mountain deserts. In 2010 the western limit of the Orientia genus extended westwards to Dubai when a patient was diagnosed with a new Orientia species (O. chuto). In southern China, human infections typically occur in the summer and in northern areas the disease occurs mainly during autumn and winter. The migration of infested or infected rodents can lead to the establishment of new foci of disease.
Contamination of wounds with soil, dust or animal feces that contain C. tetani spores. Puncture wounds are most commonly associated with tetanus but it can result from even minor abrasions. Through injection of contaminated street drugs. Neonatal tetanus results from infection of the umbilical cord, either through the use of unclean instruments to cut the cord or through dressing the stump with contaminated materials.
Human–mosquito–human around housing; monkey–mosquito–monkey and monkey–mosquito–human in the forests of West Africa and Malaysia. Human viremia lasts 3–5 days since onset of symptoms; the mosquito can transmit 8–12 days after taking a viremic blood meal, depending on the ambient temperature.
Loiasis is not as severe as other filarial diseases. Typical finding is transient subcutaneous swellings (Calabar swellings) which are angiedemas. These swellings are itchy and mainly occur on the limbs, especially forearms and when close to joints may restrict movement. Less frequently: giant urticaria, arthritis, and fever. The adult worm sometimes migrates across the subconjunctiva of the eye. Encephalopathic reactions may occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns to control onchocerciasis. These SAEs mainly occur in those with heavy infection ( > 30,000 microfilariae per ml blood).
The California group viruses are widely distributed over all types of terrain. Each has its preferred vector mosquito species and host, for instance snowshoe hare for SSHV. LACV is the primary cause of arboviral encephalitis in children in the USA. Most LACV infections occur in those residing close to woodland breeding sites of Ae. triseriatusfrom July to September. Boys are more often affected with LACV, as they more often play in the woods. JCV is most commonly found around the Great Lakes in USA and Canada. The JCV vectors prefer hilly woodlands where they breed in ponds from April to June. SSHV, has a different ecosystem: (sub) arctic forests and tundras in Canada and Siberia. SSHV has been detected in China. SSHV transmission occurs during the arctic summer from May to August, and mainly affects children (<10 years), especially boys. Lumbo virus is a strain of TAHV isolated from mosquitoes in Mozambique (Africa), but no human cases have been diagnosed there.
Sanitation. Avoid eating uncooked water plants in endemic areas. Do not fertilize water plants for consumption with human or pig feces. Abandon practice of feeding water plants to pigs. Health education. The eggs can resist low temperatures and can be maintained at 4 C for 3 to 4 months; they are killed at 50 C in 4 hours. Water can be chemically treated to kill the flukes.
Gradual onset, malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, chest, and abdominal pain; inflammation and exudation of the pharynx and conjunctivae are common. Progression to multisystem disease occurs in 20% of infections, with hypotension or shock, hemorrhage, pleural effusion, seizures, encephalopathy and edema of the face and neck. Transient alopecia, ataxia, and eighth cranial nerve deafness may follow; deafness may be permanent. In third-trimester pregnant patients, 80% have a fatal outcome and 95% of the fetuses abort. The overall CFR is 1%, but 15–20% in more severe, hospitalized patients.
Common unspecific symptoms are acute febrile illness with chills, sweats, nausea, headache, and vomiting; high fever with chills is more common in P. vivax than in P. falciparum malaria. Recent reports provide evidence that vivax malaria is not as benign as previously thought. P. vivax can lead to severe anemia, acute respiratory distress, liver failure, renal failure, and even cerebral malaria.
Rarely by tick bite.
Bilharziasis, snail fever, Katayama fever or syndrome, intestinal schistosomiasis.
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control; disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas; formalin-inactivated HTNV vaccines are used in Russia, China and Korea.
Ticks introduce Babesia spp. sporozoites from the ticks’ salivary glands into small mammals/humans during feeding. The sporozoites infect erythrocytes in which they asexually reproduce by budding and develop through various stages into gametocytes. Ticks can take up circulating gametocytes during feeding on an infected animal. The gametocytes fertilize in the tick gut and develop into sporozoites in their salivary glands.
Blood or bone marrow culture and other infected bodily tissues (urine, CSF); serology; PCR.
Diphyllobothriosis, Dibothriocephaliasis, broad or fish tapeworm infection
Demonstration of Strongyloides larvae on repeated stool specimens by microscopy after concentration (coproculture or Baermann). Stool examination has poor sensitivity, particularly in chronic cases. Serological tests vary in sensitivity and specificity, and perform better in chronic cases and are therefore used for screening patients at risk for hyperinfection. PCR has higher sensitivity than microscopy. Hyperinfection: larvae or parasite DNA can be found in sputum and other specimens.
Taenia solium infection, neurocysticercosis, cerebral cysticercosis, taeniosis, taeniasis.
Inhalation of spores from disturbed soil. There is no person-to-person transmission.
Access to clean water and sanitation; protective clothing for occupational risk; after accidental exposure, dry the skin and apply 70% alcohol; mollusciciding; avoid contact with contaminated water bodies.
Vaccination with vaccines based on capsular polysaccharides. Both conjugated and non-jugated vaccines are available. Conjugated vaccines targeting either 7, 9, 10, or 13 capsule types are recommended for children under 5 years of age and risk groups. The 23-valent non-conjugated vaccine can only be used in individuals older than 2 years and at high risk of disease. National surveillance of pneumococcal disease and infecting serotypes is required to detect vaccine escapees, requiring vaccine modification. Individuals are not protected against pneumococcal capsule types not in the vaccine. Through the GAVI Alliance, low-income countries can access pneumococcal vaccines with a small contribution. Rwanda was the first GAVI-eligible country that introduced the vaccine in 2009.
The dimorphic fungi: Histoplasma capsulatum (worldwide) and H. capsulatum var. duboisii (Africa). The fungi grow as a mycelium in the soil at ambient temperatures and convert to the yeast form in the lung at body temperature.
Personal anti-tick precautions. An inactivated mouse-brain vaccine is in use in Russia and eastern Europe. Healthcare workers caring for CCHF patients are at risk and need to take proper barrier precautions.
Piscivorous (fish-eating) mammals, including: humans, dogs, cats, pigs, rats, and several species of wild animals. Humans can remain infected for several decades.
Human.
Control deer population; avoid areas with ticks; tick bite precautions: cover skin, repellent on skin and clothing (permethrin, DEET), check daily for attached ticks and remove.
HME, HGA: fever, headache, anorexia, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting; occasionally a rash. Leucopenia and thrombopenia are common and thrombopenia may be life-threatening. HME cases may progress to meningoencephalitis. Sennetsu fever: sudden onset fever, chills, malaise, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat; generalized lymphadenopathy. Reinfection can occur. CFR is 2.7% for HME, <1% for HGA, and absent for E. ewingii infection.
Through inhalation of aerosolized microconidia from disturbed soil or guano. Also by inoculation and organ transplantation.
Sudden onset of high fever, headache, chills, vomiting, myalgias, photophobia and dysthesias; 50–90% of apparent cases develop encephalitis. In the USA, one-third of encephalitis cases die and one-third of the survivors are moderately to severely disabled.
Francisella tularensis tularensis (Type A), F. tularensis holarctica (Type B), F. tularensis mediasiatica, Gram-negative non-motile intracellular coccobacilli that infect macrophages. Type A is highly virulent and divided into two clades: Francisella tularensis tularensis (Type A), F. tularensis holarctica (Type B), F. tularensis mediasiatica, Gram-negative non-motile intracellular coccobacilli that infect macrophages.
Ribavirin in combination with peg-interferon. Response to interferon differs by HCV genotype: there is a more sustained virological response in HCV genotype 2 and 3 infections, as compared to HCV genotype1 and 4. The peg-interferon and ribavarin response can be improved by the combination with oral DNA-polymerase and protease inhibitors.
During blood meal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.
Simian variola.
TBRF is primarily transmitted by Ornithodoros ticks. LBRF is transmitted by the human body louse (Pediculus humanus); neither the head louse nor the pubic louse has been shown to transmit the disease.
High fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, maculopapular rash beginning on the face, spreading downwards to reach the hands and feet. Characteristic small white spots (Koplik spots) on the buccal mucosa. Complications may consist of otitis media, pneumonia, laryngotracheal bronchitis (croup), blindness, severe skin infections, severe diarrhea and encephalitis, sometimes fatal. Complications are more common and more severe in people with malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, and chronic diseases. Very rarely, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis may appear years later.
Hendra virus: manage contact between fruit bats and horse by basic husbandry measures such as placing food and water points under cover, regulate movement of horses from areas where the disease is occurring, regulate import of horses from Australia during outbreaks. Nipah virus: avoid contact with fruit bats and their discharges; wash and peel fruit, and wash hands before and after preparing fruit; regulate importation of pigs from outbreak areas.
Tabanid adult female flies, mainly Chrysops silacea, C. dimidiata, and C. distinctipennis. These day-biting and bloodsucking flies breed in forested and damp environments (e.g. swamps or rotten vegetation). Other favorable environments are cocoa plantations. Chrysops are attracted by movement, dark objects, and smoke. The vector does not enter structures like homes or barns. Up to 18% of the vector population can be infected with L. loa in endemic areas.
Microscopy of stained thick blood smears taken around noon; membrane filtration; PCR. Eosinophilia and high IgE levels are indicators of active infection.
Human infections occur via two main transmission routes: (1) mosquito bite, and (2) direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals (e.g. slaughtering, butchering, veterinary procedures, animal births, disposing of carcasses or fetuses) by percutaneous inoculation or inhaling aerosols. Transmissionmay be possible via consumption of raw milk of an infected animal. Person-toperson transmission has not been described. However, humans develop high viral loads in the blood, and may transmit virus to contacts.
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. Antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign, or misdiagnosed and underreported. Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. Cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern Brazil and north Iran. This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. In Southeast Asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water. In northeast Thailand, 20% of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis, which accounts for 39% of fatal septicemias and 36% of fatal community-acquired pneumonias. Up to 80% of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal disease, or alcoholism, age, chronic infection, or immunosuppressive therapy. Sporadic human infections with glanders (B. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.
Vector control; mosquito repellent; insecticidetreated bed nets; treatment of infected humans.
Humans are the main reservoir. S. haematobium can infect primates, livestock and rodents. S. mansoni, S. intercalatum, and S. guineensis can infect rodents.
Usually asymptomatic or mild. Diarrhea alternating with constipation, vomiting and anorexia, edema of the face, abdominal wall and legs, ascites. Heavy worm loads may cause bowel obstruction. Eosinophilia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and secondary anemia may occur.
This is unknown at present. M. ulcerans has been found in biofilms on vegetation in swamps and other permanent wetlands, aquatic insects, snails, and fish. In Australia, some land animals, particularly native possums, have been found to carry M. ulcerans in their gastrointestinal tracts.
Combination of atovaquone and azithromycin for mild-to-moderate illness, clindamycin and quinine for severe disease. Exchange transfusion for life-threatening infection, dialysis in case of renal failure. Chloroquine is ineffective.
Healthy humans can carry S. pneumoniae in their upper respiratory tract.
Blastomyces dermatitidis (teleomorph Ajellomyces dermatitidis), a dimorphic fungus: grows as a pathogenic yeast at body temperature and as a mold in the environment.
Principally humans; also warm-water marine and estuarine copepods, other zooplankton. Crabs, shrimps, and shellfish carry the vibrio on their carapaces and shells.
Pasteurize milk; do not eat unpasteurized dairy products, especially in endemic areas; brucellosis control in domestic animals; hygienic measures in farms and slaughter houses; screening of livestock. Laboratory infections occur where biosafety measures are not adequate.
Rat–mollusc–rat; humans are incidental dead-end hosts. Larvae are excreted with rat feces, ingested by vectormolluscs, in which they develop into the infecting third stage larvae in about 12 days. When ingested by a rat, the larvae enter the brain, mature into adults, and migrate through the bloodstream to the lungs. There, female worms lay eggs (about 15,000 per day) that hatch into larvae, which in 6–8 weeks migrate through the bronchial system up the trachea to the pharynx, are swallowed and excreted. When ingested by a human, the third stage larvae also migrate to the CNS, but the worm does not mature.
Drain abscesses, iv ceftazidime, meropenem or imipenem followed by eradication treatment using cotrimoxazole, with or without doxycycline. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an alternative for those with resistant strains or where co-trimoxazole is contraindicated. Also usually sensitive to piperacillin or ticarcillin with clavulanic acid. There is an up to 10% relapse rate.
Culture (cysteine-enriched media) or PCR on specimens of affected tissues. Blood cultures are often negative. Testing should be done in a BSL-3 facility. Serology on acute and convalescent sera.
The natural reservoir is unclear. The fungus can be isolated from nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). The disease has also been reported in dogs and other animals. Culturing the fungus from soil is difficult and regularly negative. As armadillos have close contact with soil, it is expected that soil is a reservoir. By using ninebanded armadillos as sentinel animals, it has been shown that the habitat of P. brasiliensis is likely humid vegetation close to water sources.
Anthrax has a worldwide distribution. Livestock vaccination, antibiotic treatment, and quarantaine regulations lead to a strong decline in anthraxinfections in domestic lifestock. Anthrax occurs mainly in rural areas in countries where there is no livestock vaccination and no veterinary control of slaughtered animals.There is a seasonal variation in animal disease with an increase in cases during hot dry weather. Anthrax is an occupational hazard for people who process contaminated animal tissues. GI anthrax occurs when infected tissue is ingested. Of note is the terrorist distribution of anthrax powder by mail in the USA in 2001, which killed 5 people and produced sickness in 17.
Pus contains visible granules, histopathology of biopsy, culture (slow).
The disease mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes, shown by patches of pigmented or reddish skin with loss of sensation, peripheral nerve enlargement with loss of sensation, sometimes paralysis, muscle wasting and trophic ulcers. Patients are classified as having either PL or ML. PL is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions. ML is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions. Skin lesions are often symmetric. Involvement of the nasal mucosa results in nasal congestion and epistaxis. Reduced sensation of digits may lead to their loss due to trauma. Up to 10% of cases with early lesions may resolve spontaneously.
Studies of unvaccinated populations in some western countries indicate that almost everyone will be infected with mumps by adulthood; however the epidemiology of mumps is less well characterized in developing countries. The true number of mumps cases is not known, since it is often a mild disease and reported cases probably represent fewer than 10% of all infections. There is geographic variation in circulating mumps virus genotypes, and there can be several genotypes circulating simultaneously in one area and shifts over time in predominant genotypes. Mumps vaccination is recommended at age 12–18 months and is included in the standardimmunization program ofmost developed countries, usually in a trivalent vaccine with measles and rubella (MMR vaccine). A booster dose in later childhood is also recommended for countries with a good immunization program. Several developed countries with a well-established mumps vaccination program have experienced significant outbreaks in young adults, who were too old to be included in the childhood immunization schedule and had not been exposed to natural infection due to an overall reduction in the transmission of mumps in the population. Other possible reasons for mumps outbreaks in vaccinated populations include a waning of vaccine-induced immunity and genotype mismatch between the vaccine strain and the wild virus. Since the complications of mumps are more common in affected adults compared to affected children, a shift in the average age of infection can lead to an increase in the number of observed complications. However, despite these issues, it must be remembered that comprehensive mumps vaccination programs are associated with a massive overall decrease in the burden of mumps morbidity.
Noma is an opportunistic infection that evolves rapidly from a gingival inflammation to severe, mutilating orofacial gangrene, which is painless and usually unilateral. It begins as a small vesicle or ulcer on the gingiva that rapidly becomes necrotic and spreads to produce extensive destruction of the buccal and labial mucosa and tissues of the face, including the bone, which may result in severe disfigurement and even death. Noma can also cause tissue damage to the genitals (noma pudenda).
Hares, hedgehogs, wild mice, livestock, ostriches. Since hard ticks overwinter and can pass the virus transovarially, ticks also serve as reservoirs.
There is little known about the epidemiology of these viruses. Group C viruses are geograpically limited to the tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas, and were first described in the Brazilian Amazon in the 1950s. Studies show that these viruses circulate in a compact ecosystem in which co-infection with more than one virus is possible in reservoir hosts, leading to genetic reassortment. Genetic analysis shows evidence of intense traffic of these viruses in the Americas. Nepuyo virus has the widest distribution reported, from Mexico to Brazil. There is no sex or age preference for infection. Inapparent and mild infections are common, overt disease is mostly seen in children residing in endemic areas.
Similar to syphilis, the clinical manifestations can be classified into early and late stages. Early-stage lesions are generally infectious and may last up to 5 years, with periods of latency. The disease has a relapsing clinical course with mainly skin manifestations, which is the only finding in pinta. In yaws and endemic syphilis there is also involvement of the mucous membranes and the bones. Cardiovascular and neurological lesions are extremely rare.
Bat to bat via unknown route. Humans and domestic animals are incidental hosts.
It is estimated that 37 million people are infected worldwide, 97% of them in Africa, and remaining in small foci in Central and South America and Yemen. Onchocerciasis was imported into Latin America by the slave trade. Onchocerciasis prevalence is related to the proximity to riverine breeding sites of black flies, with the highest disease burden in communities adjacent to rivers. Prevalence of infection rises with age until around 20 years, after which infection profiles vary between geographical region and sex. Higher rates of morbidity are reported in men. This variation canbe explainedby heterogeneity in age, gender, and occupational exposure to vectors.
Viremic reservoir host to mosquito during feeding, then after an extrinsic cycle of a few days, the virus is transmitted to a new reservoir host during feeding.
By mosquito bite (Anopheles spp.); transmission has been described in needle sharing IVDUs and blood transfusion.
Zika virus is present in the tropical regions in the Old World and is absent from the Americas (a single case in the USA was imported from Yap island). The competence of mosquitoes on the American continent for Zika virus is unknown. The geographic distribution is confirmed by virus isolation from cases, mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys. Positive results in serosurveys are not conclusive, because of extensive cross-reactions among flaviviruses. In 2007 a virgin soil epidemic affected 73% of the population of Yap island. There were no hospitalizations or deaths during this outbreak. Due to intense air travel in the Pacific region and presence of competent vectors, there is concern that the disease will spread to other islands and even beyond. Adult females have higher attack rates and few cases are found above the age of 60 years. Approximately 18% of individuals infected by the Zika virus develop symptoms; this is similar to that reported for West Nile virus infection.
Microscopy for eggs in stool (S. mansoni) or urine (S. haematobium) samples; quantification of eggs in stool by Kato–Katz method and in urine by standardized filtration techniques; PCR.
Praziquantel; surgery in case of biliary obstruction.
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control, disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas.
Epidemic non-A non-B hepatitis, fecal–oral non-A non-B hepatitis, enterically transmitted nonA non-B hepatitis.
Avoid tick bites, use repellent on skin and repellent or acaricide on clothing, check body daily for ticks after exposure, boil or pasteurize milk from cows, sheep, and goats in endemic areas. An inactivated vaccine is available. Specific hyperimmune globulin used in the past as prophylaxis after tick-bite may worsen the disease.
Female blackflies (Simulium). Transmission by S. damnosum complex in Africa is responsible for > 95% onchocerciasis cases. S. neavei complex in East Africa and S. rasyani in Yemen. In Latin America: Female blackflies (Simulium). Transmission by S. damnosum complex in Africa is responsible for > 95% onchocerciasis cases. S. neavei complex in East Africa and
Deer and dogs (E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii). The whitetailed deer is a complete host for maintaining the transmission cycle of E. chaffeensis. Deer, ruminants, and field rodents (A. phagocytophilum); unknown for N. sennetsu; other members of the genus parasitize the trematode worms of aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates.
Rarely reported in the Americas and Europe, sporadic in parts of Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, China, and Vietnam. Most important risk factor is contact with pigs or uncooked pig products, typically by farmers, veterinary personnel, abattoir workers, and butchers. Furthermore, in several Asian countries it is common to consume uncooked pork products, like blood, which is a risk for acquiring the disease. Individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those who have been splenectomized, are also at increased risk. Since S. suis is often misidentified, S. suis may be more common in certain parts of the world with high pig densities.
Typically a cardiopulmonary infection as opposed to the primarily renal infection produced by Old World hantaviruses; renal involvement and hemorrhage are rare in NewWorld cases. Symptoms are fever, myalgia, and GI pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension, with rapid progression to respiratory failure and shock. Convalescence is prolonged. CFR is 35–60%.
Soil with high nitrogen content, particularly areas with a lot of bird or bat guano, like barns and caves. Blackbird roosts can also be heavily contaminated. Unlike bats, birds are not infected by H. capsulatum and do not excrete the fungus in their droppings. Bird droppings are considered a nutrient source for fungal growth in the already contaminated soil.
By mosquito bite.
Self-limiting conjunctivitis, including watery or mucopurulent discharge. Typical findings are lymphoid follicles and papillary hypertrophy. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the conjunctiva and trichiasis. Trichiasis damages the corneal surface, resulting in keratitis, vascularization of the cornea, and impaired defence against secondary bacterial and fungal infection. Corneal damage produces corneal scar, leading to blindness.
Humans. Rotaviruses in animals are distinct from those causing disease in humans.
Infections are most frequent in a period of drought and winds (dust storms) after heavy rains that advance mold growth, usually late summer or early fall. It is estimated that more than 150,000 primary infections occur annually in the USA. Incidence in California and Arizona appears to have increased since 1991 and again since 2001, probably driven by immigration of non-immunes andwheather conditions that favor dissemination of the fungus. Prevalence of infection in northern Mexico is reported to be 10–40%. Male gender, African-American and Filipino race/ethnicity, immunosuppression, diabetes, older age and pregnancy are risk factors for chronic and disseminated disease. Infections outside the western hemisphere are extremely rare and primarily imported.
Avoid exposure to feces of reservoir species wash hands, fruit and vegetables, periodically treat high-risk dogs, eliminate ownerless dogs. Praziquantel-containing baits have reduced infection in urban foxes and water voles in Switzerland and Germany. Eggs are highly sensitive to elevated temperatures and desiccation, but survive for months at freezing temperatures and are not affected by common disinfectants or ethanol.
Brucella spp. is introduced into animals via inhalation, broken skin, or mucosa and invades local lymph nodes where it propagates and enters the bloodstream and disseminates to mainly the reticulo-endothelial system (bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes), kidneys and placenta in pregnant animals. From infected organs, like mammary glands, kidneys, and placenta, viable bacteria are shedded into the environment by milk, urine, and uterine discharge, leading to new infections in exposed animals and humans.
Clostridium tetani, a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium. The spores can remain viable in the environment for years. C. tetani produces a highly potent exotoxin, tetanospasmin, which is responsible for the clinical features of tetanus.
Recovery of S. pneumoniae from sputum, blood, CSF or other normally sterile fluids by culture or PCR. S. pneumoniae antigen test in urine.
E. histolytica is distributed world wide, especially in countries with poor sanitation and little access to clean water (see Water and Sanitation maps). It is estimated that E. histolytica is responsible for 40,000 to 100,000 deaths per year. Most prevalence studies in the past did not distinguish between E. histolytica and the non-pathogenic E. dispar, and therefore little is known of the current disease prevalence of the pathogenic E. histolytica. E. histolytica infection is endemic in Mexico, India, South Africa, some Central and South American countries, and Asian Pacific countries. Community-based studies in urban slums in Bangladesh showed that: 9% of preschool children suffer from amebic diarrhea each year, with 2% requiring a hospital visit. In developed countries, amebiasis is seen in travelers and immigrants from developing countries, and cases may also be found in closed psychiatric institutions. MSM are also a risk group, since they are more exposed.
High altitude rodents, including ground squirrels and porcupines; ticks by trans-stadial transmission; possibly transovarial, but this is considered unlikely.
Serology (IgM ELISA, IFA of erythrocytes). Diagnosis is confirmed by a significant ( > 4-fold) change in antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera. Virus isolation or RNA detection by RT-PCR from the blood or CSF.
The most prevalent HTLV-1 clinical manifestations can be divided into those associated with ATL (immunosuppression) or associated with HAM/TSP (immunoactivation). The HTLV-1-infected individual who immunologically tends to immunosuppression can develop opportunistic infections such as Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection, recurrent skin infections and ATL. The HTLV-1infected individual who tends to immunoactivation can develop HTLV-associated uveitis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, arthritis, pulmonary infiltrative pneumonitis, Sjogren syndrome and HAM/TSP.
Direct: acid fast smear/culture and PCR of sputum and other body fluids, depending on clinical presentation; serological: tuberculin skin test (Mantoux); interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs). Culture in liquid media is gold standard and allows for antibiotic susceptibility testing but takes weeks to months; PCR allows for early detection, and recent assays include detection of resistance-associated mutations.
Consumption of raw or undercooked uneviscerated fish that have ingested infected feces of humans or waterfowl. There is no person-to-person transmission.
Pentavalent antimonials; pentamidine; amphotericin. Other drugs and regimens are being tested (including paramomycin, miltefosine).
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Fish-eating mammals (including humans) shed C. sinensis eggs into the environment that are ingested by snails, where they develop into cercariae. The motile cercariae are released into water and infect freshwater fish and encyst in meat and skin as metacercariae. When ingested by mammals, the metacercariae migrate into the bile ducts where they develop into adult flukes that produce and excrete eggs into feces. The cycle takes approximately 3 months.
Detection of spirochetemia in blood smears with dark-field or conventional microscopy; blood culture in special media or mouse inoculation; quantitative buffy coat (QBC) fluorescence; PCR.
Influenza A subtype H5N1, a RNA virus, family Orthomyxoviridae. Avian influenza H5N1 occurs in two forms, a virulent form known as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) and a milder form known as ‘low pathogenic’ (LPAI H5N1). H5N1 viruses have diverged into geographically distinct strains (genetic clades).
Phlebotomine sandfly: Lutzomyia spp. (New World) and Phlebotomus spp. (Old World).
Epidemic or louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF), endemic or tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF).
Taeniosis: detection of eggs in stool by microscopy; T. solium eggs can not be distinguished from T. saginata eggs; serology; Neurocysticercosis: histology; CT or MRI scan brain; serology is not sensitive or specific for neurocysticercosis.
Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a nematode lungworm of rats. Adult worms are 17 to 25 mm long. Angiostrongylus costaricensis is the causal agent of abdominal, or intestinal, angiostrongyliasis and is not shown on the map. Other pathogens, like Gnathostoma spinigerum, are able to cause eosinophilic meningitis, but are not shown on the map.
Treponema pallidum ssp. endemicum (bejel), T. pallidum ssp. pertenue (yaws), and T. carateum (pinta), spirochetes that are morphologically and serologically similar to T. pallidum ssp. pallidum, the agent of syphilis.
IgM capture or IgG ELISAs is most commonly used on paired acute and convalescent sera. Virus isolation in suckling mice or cell culture and identified by RT-PCR.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), Korean Hemorrhagic Fever, Hemorrhagic Nephrosonephritis, Nephropathia epidemica
The principal clinical feature of tetanus is painful skeletal muscle spasms and rigidity. Three clinical forms are recognized. The commonest is generalized tetanus, which usually begins with spasms of the facial muscles and spreads in a descending pattern. On presentation patients commonly have ‘lockjaw’ (trismus), neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, and abdominal rigidity. Generalized spasms may result in an arched posture (opisthotonus). Other symptoms include elevated temperature, blood pressure, and sweating. Localized tetanus presents as localized spasms of muscles around the entry wound. Cephalic tetanus is rare and results from infection in the head and neck, and affects cranial nerves.
None.
Detection of virus in respiratory specimens, stool or blood by RT-PCR; virus isolation; serology by IFA or ELISA. Specimen processing and testing should be performed under strict biosafety measures (BSL-3).
None.

Supportive with pain management.
Infected individuals shed bacteria into environment, contaminating water and food products that are subsequently ingested by other humans.
Cattle with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy.
Microscopy to detect microfilariae in finger-prick blood smears; immunochromatic test cards; ultrasound to locate ‘nests.’
Undetermined. Thought to be forest rodents (squirrels, rats, mice, dormice), shrews and monkeys in the rainforests of West and Central Africa.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, Four Corners disease.
Larval mites. Nymphs and adults do not feed on vetebrate hosts. The vector has adapted to various ecologies, including mountainous and tropical regions.
Onchocerca volvulus, a filarial nematode (roundworm). Adult female worm is approximately 50 cm long.
The tick feeds on an infected host, the virusmultipliesin the tick’s midgut and spreads to the salivary glands, to be injected into another host at the next feed, where it infects erythrocytes. As the virus infects erythrocytes, it is partially protected from immune clearance, leading to prolonged viremia in both humans (up to 4 months) and rodents, favoring spread.
Yersinia pestis, a Gram-negative bacillus. Y. pestis is considered a potential biological warfare agent.
Contact with freshwater bodies containing cercariae that penetrate skin or mucous membranes; drinking contaminated water (uncommon).
The mosquito becomes infected with MAYV during feeding on a viremic host. The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the mosquito. After a few days, depending on the ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding.
Sudden onset of high fever (biphasic), chills, myalgia, arthralgia, severe headache, ocular pain, conjunctivitis, anorexia, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. Spleen and liver can be palpable, and pericarditis or myocarditis may be found. A few cases have a petechial or maculopapular rash. Prolonged convalescence may follow. Children may have a more severe syndrome with hemorrhagic manifestations, including a more pronounced rash, DIC, and GI bleeding; or CNS involvement including meningitis and encephalitis. Fatalities are rare.
Bunyamwera group viruses are enveloped, singlestranded, RNA viruses genus Orthobunyavirus of the family Bunyaviridae (see also Bunyavirus Group C map). Bunyamwera group viruses that can cause human disease in Africa are: Bunyamwera group viruses are enveloped, singlestranded, RNA viruses genus Orthobunyavirus of the family
Serology to detect specific IgM antibodies; RT-PCR to detect viral RNA in blood or stool.
Community management by SAFE strategy (see above). The WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma (GET 2020) seeks to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.
Bartonella bacilliformis, a fastidious intracellular Gramnegative bacterium.
Early diagnosis and treatment; safe sexual practices (condom use). Proper bodily hygiene.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Serology (acute and convalescent sera) using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Isolation of leptospira from blood or CSF during first 10 days of illness and urine during the 2nd and 3rd weeks; PCR may provide early diagnosis. Dark-field microscopy is not recommended.
For bacteria, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, long-acting sulfonamides; for fungi, itraconazole, ketaconazole, or voriconazole. Resection of small lesions; advanced lesions may require amputation of the hand or leg.
None.
Painless cutaneous lesions appear at the site of sandfly bite and typically these develop into ulcers with a raised border. Occasionally nodular and rarely verrucous lesions. Multiple lesions and regional lymphadenopathy may be present. Lesions may resolve spontaneously or remain for several months to years. Rarely dissemination to mucosa occurs of the upper respiratory tract with local tissue destruction leading to disfigurement (most often by L. braziliensis, known as espundia), with risk of severe and sometimes fatal secondary infections.
By tick bite; larval ticks are carried on migrating birds, which are refractory to the virus. The virus is also spread among veterinarians, farmers, shepherds, butchers, and slaughter-house workers by contact with the blood of infected livestock. Person-to-person spread is by contact with infectious body fluids of patients.
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a dimorphic fungus. At room temperature, P. brasiliensis is a mold and at body temperature (37 C) a yeast.
Supportive and antibiotics: oral doxycycline, ampicillin or amoxicillin for mild disease, parenteral penicillin G, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for severe disease.
Fever, cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. Flukes may invade the brain and rarely the spinal cord, causing meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, and paralysis. They may also cause acute and chronic inflammation of the pleura, pericardium, and mediastinum. Chest Xray findings are similar to tuberculosis. Complications include pleural effusion, pneumothorax, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary fibrosis.
Wild, migratory birds of the order Passeriformes (mainlyfieldfare, redwing, and songthrush) and Anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans). Tetraonid birds (grouse) population size changes coincide with SINV epidemics in Finland. Larger passerine species have higher prevalences of infection as compared to smaller species.
Mumps is preventable by the use of live attenuated mumps virus vaccines. Various vaccine strains are available and may vary in immunogenicity and the incidence of adverse effects, such as fever, rash, parotitis, or meningitis.
By sexual contact. In children with no history of abuse, the route of transmission is unclear. Several reported pediatric cases have been in contact with infected adults, but without evidence of sexual contact.
Praziquantel is recommended; alternative: oxamniquine for S. mansoni, metrifonate for S. haematobium.
By inhalation of aerosolized excreta of the rodent host, or contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. Nosocomial transmission is regular in resource-constrained settings.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA flavivirus. It is divided into five antigenic groups and four genotypes, whichmay belinked to differences in virulence.
Microscopy for eggs, larvae and/or adult worms in the stool, or in intestinal biopsies for C. philippinensis (eggs resemble those of Trichuris trichiura).
It is an occupational risk for those working in the environment in endemic regions (e.g. farmers, soldiers). Dust control where feasible (e.g. paving roads). Arthroconidia are resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can survive for many years in dust. Screening of organ donors for coccidioidomycosis in endemic areas. As the fungus is easily aerosolized it is a laboratory hazard.
Buruli ulcer is named after Buruli county in Uganda, where the disease was common in the 1960s. The disease is reported in 30 countries with tropical climates, but it may occur in some temperate regions. West Africa is the most affected region. Typical Buruli endemic regions are areas with slow-flowing or stagnant water. Flooding due to deforestation or the construction of dams, and irrigation systems such as rice fields, can lead to outbreaks. Outbreaks have also been associated with mining activities in Africa, due to creation of pits with stagnant water. In southern Australia several coastal towns have reported local outbreaks. It is unclear what triggered these outbreaks. World wide, mainly children are susceptible to Buruli ulcer disease.
Individuals with trichiasis require eyelid surgery. Active disease requires antibiotics: azithromycin or tetracycline eye ointment are recommended. Treatment of individual cases has little impact, because of rapid reinfection. Community management using the SAFE strategy (Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics to clear infection, Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement [water and sanitation] to reduce transmission) is the recommended means for control in endemic areas; this strategy includes both treatment and prevention.
Infective larvae migrate out of the mouth part of the fly during bite onto the skin and subsequently enter the wound. The tabanid bite is painful with blood loss.
By airborne droplets from or contact with nose and throat secretions of infected persons, very high from 4 days before to 4 days after rash appears, or with fomites contaminated with those secretions. Droplets remain infectious for several hours, longer under conditions of low humidity. Measles virus is highly contagious.
Ingestion of tapeworm eggs from feces of foxes, dogs, and cats or contaminated fomites. There is no person-to-person transmission.
Hendra virus: pteropid bats are the primary reservoir of Hendra virus and are asymptomatic. The viruses can be isolated from their reproductive tracts and urine. The epidemiological reasons for the emergence of Hendra virus infection in horses are not clear. All human cases had close contact with infected horses. Nipah virus outbreaks have occurred only in South Asia and may be associated with the bat-breeding season. In Malaysia, it was hypothesized that the bats fed on fruit trees in pig farms, and that fallen fruit contaminated with bat saliva containing Nipah virus was eaten by pigs, who became infected. Nipah viruses have been isolated from bats in Cambodia and Thailand, and a high seroprevalence has been found in fruit bats in NW India, in the absence of reported pig or human disease. In Bangladesh, there is epidemiologic evidence of bat–human transmission without an intermediate livestock host, and of human–human transmission. Young boys who gather fruit from the trees are at higher risk of disease. Also drinking palm sap from trees is a potential risk factor. Antibodies to henipaviruses have been found in fruit bats in Madagascar (Pteropus and Eidolon sp.) and in Ghana (Eidolon sp.), but in the absence of virus isolation or RNA detection, it is not possible to know which virus is involved. No human or animal cases have been reported in Madagascar or in Africa.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment
For C. philippinensis: fish-eating birds. Freshwater fish are intermediate hosts.
None.
Rodent control in and around dwellings; infection control in hospitals, with barrier nursing and precautions to avoid contact with body fluids.
Mosquitoes. The main vector of enzootic VEEV is the Culex (Melanoconion) spp. (Spissipes group). During VEEV outbreaks, Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus is often the main vector in coastal regions. Epizootic/epidemic subtypes of VEEV are transmitted by mosquitoes of many different genera.
The principle vector is the human body louse (Pediculus humanus corporis), which lives in clothes. B. quintana has also been detected in cat and monkey fleas.
Occupational hygiene by the use of protective clothing and avoiding contaminated surface waters (difficult in case of flooding in developing countries). Environmental control measures, like rodent and flood control, are difficult to implement. Chemoprophylaxis for adventure travelers, military personnel who visit endemic areas, and after an accidental lab exposure.
Mainly humans. In Southeast Asia, monkeys, wild carnivores, dogs, and cats may also be infected with B. malayi. W. bancrofti has no known reservoir host.
Soil, animal hair, wool or hides, particularly goat skins contaminated with soil. Spores can germinate outside an animal under appropriate conditions.
Direct fecal–oral transmission and via contaminated surfaces. Rotavirus has also been detected in repiratory secretions.
World wide, but close to elimination in the Americas and targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015. In the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95%, but is most often over 50%. Reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections. CRS is also grossly underreported. For example, it is estimated that over 45,000 CRS cases occur annually in Southeast Asia yet only an average of 13 CRS cases per year were reported to WHO between 2000 and 2009. Rubella is a public health concern because of CRS and in 1996 it was estimated that 110,000 CRS cases occurred annually in developing countries. Paradoxically, a poor rubella immunization program may actually increase the incidence of CRS if the burden of illness is shifted to young adults, where pregnancy is common. Therefore rubella immunization programs must achieve and maintain high immunization rates ( > 80%) or be supplemented by the immunization of women of childbearing age. In 2009 two-thirds of countries included a rubella containing vaccine in their national immunization schedule yet in many developing countries rubella vaccine has not been included because of lack of information on the burden of CRS, costs, and concerns about causing a paradoxical increase in CRS cases.
Lassa fever virus (LFV), a spherical, enveloped, bisegmented negative strand RNA virus of the genus Arenavirus in the family Arenaviridae.
Lice infestation (pediculosis) can be controlled by treating clothes and bedding with insecticides or boiling (bedding at shelters is a major source of lice infestation). The body does not need to be deloused as the lice live and lay their eggs in clothes or bedding. Oral ivermectin has been effective in delousing homeless people.
By contact with the excretions, or materials contaminated with the excretions, of an infected rodent, such as ingestion of contaminated food or by direct contact of abraded or broken skin with rodent excrement. Infection can also occur by inhalation of minute particles soiled with rodent urine or saliva (aerosol transmission). Person-to-person transmission is rare and known only for Machupo virus.
Characterized by high fever of 2–7 days alternating with afebrile periods of 4–14 days, relapsing up to 13 times. Initial symptoms include generalized body aches, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, chills, sweats, and a transitory rash. Later symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dry cough, photophobia, neck pain, conjunctivitis, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, confusion; rarely hematuria and epistaxis. Long-term sequelae of TBRF include cardiac, neurological, and renal abnormalities, ophthalmia and abortion. LBRF is generally more severe than TBRF, but associated with fewer relapses.
For S. stercoralis: mainly humans, although infections in non-human primates and dogs have been described. S. fuelleborni is mainly found in in monkeys, but human-to-human transmission may occur in some geographical regions.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an enveloped RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. CHIKV belongs to the same antigenic complex as Mayaro, Ross River, and o’nyong-nyong viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests an African origin about 500 years ago, with spread to Asia within the last century.
The primary vectors are ticks and biting flies (deer flies, tabanids). In central Europe: Dermacentor reticulatus and Ixodes ricinus are important vectors. In eastern USA, D. variabilis is the most important vector. In western USA, biting flies are the predominant vectors in arid regions. In Russia, transmission is both by ticks (Ixodes) and mosquitoes.
Rickettsia aeschlimannii, R. africae (ATBF), R. australis (QTT), R. conorii caspia (AF), R. conorii conorii (MSF), R. conorii indica (ITT), R. conorii israelensis (ISF), R. helvetica, R. honei (FISF), R. japonica (JSF/OSF), R. massiliae, R. sibirica (STT/ NATT), Gram-negative intracellular bacilli. New agents are still being discovered regularly.
Microscopy (Kato-Katz method). Quantitative fecal egg counts are a marker for worm burden: 2,000 to 4,000 eggs per gram of feces is considered to be moderate infection, and 4,000 eggs is heavy infection.
Mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito. There is an enzootic cycle, mainly between C. taralsis and passerine birds. There is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits. Viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds. Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days. Humans and horses are dead-end hosts for WEEV because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes.
Lockjaw.
Since the end of 2003 the A/H5N1 virus has spread globally, infecting poultry in over 60 countries and causing the loss of over 250 million poultry. In 2010 HPAI H5N1 remained entrenched in poultry in several Asian countries and Egypt. While migratory waterfowl plays a role in the long-distance spread of H5N1 (see Bird Migration map), the intensification of poultry farming and poorly regulated movement and trade in poultry is probably the most important factor in sustaining the current epizootic. HPAI H5N1 is highly contagious between birds and has a high fatality in most poultry species, making it an economically important disease. However, it is the risk to humans that has driven most of the control activities. Over 500 human cases have been detected in 15 countries. The concern remains that H5N1 may evolve or reassort with another influenza A virus to become either more transmissible from poultry to humans or transmissible from person to person.
Approximately 15 to 20 million people worldwide are believed to be infected. In Africa all HTLV and STLV subtypes are found, and phylogenetic research suggest that HTLV-1 originated in Africa about 27,000 years ago. HTLV-1 infection is more common in women and the prevalence increases with age, with a peak incidence around age 50. Among HTLV-1 carriers, the lifetime risk of developing HAM/TSP ranges from between 0.3% and 4%. For ATL, this risk is estimated to be 1% to 5% and for HTLV-1-associated diseases in general, including ATL, HAM/TSP, uveitis, polymyositis and arthropathy, the lifetime risk may be close to 10%. Japan, Africa, Caribbean islands and South America are the areas of highest prevalence, but the reasons for this are unknown. Most infections world wide are due to subtype HTLV-1a. Distribution of the infection is focal, e.g. Brazil, Japan, and Iran, where HTLV-1 is limited to certain areas of each country. On several Japanese islands the prevalence can reach 37%. Socioeconomic or genetic factors may contribute to the development of HTLV-associated infective dermatitis, since the disease has not been reported in HTLV-1 epidemic Japan. For non-endemic areas such as Europe and North America, HTLV-1 infection is mainly found in immigrants from endemic areas, their offspring and sexual contacts, among sex workers and IVDUs.
WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds. Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999, WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world. Since the introduction to northeast America, the virus has spread to most regions in North America, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and several cases in South America. The national average annual incidence of neuroinvasive disease in the USA during 1999 to 2008 was 0.40 per 100,000 population (range: 0.01–1.02). In that time period in the USA, 28,961 cases were confirmed, including 1,131 deaths. Neuroinvasive disease incidence is higher among males, especially among persons aged 60 years. The highest incidence of neuroinvasive disease occurredin theWest Central and Mountain regions, probably resulting from the high efficiency of Cx. tarsalis as both an epizootic and epidemic WNV vector in those areas. Most US cases occur in the late summer, when Culex mosquitoes are more active and after WNV amplification in the bird reservoir. In warm climates year-round transmission is seen.
Microscopy: in Giemsa-stained blood smears Schüfnner’s dots are seen; rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs); PCR.
The mites are infected by feeding on reservoir animals (small rodents), and maintain the infection throughout their life stages. The infection is passed on by transovarial transmission. O. tsutsugamushi are present in the salivary glands of the larvae and injected into the host during feeding.
Immunization with tetanus toxoid (inactivated tetanus toxin). Immunization of pregnant women protects infants from neonatal tetanus.
Prevent intimate contact with cases and contamination of environment from lesions. Lesions or discharge from the lesions are infectious. Treat close contacts. There has been a drastic decline in global disease prevalence since mass treatment campaigns with penicillin under the technical guidance ofWHO and with material support from UNICEF in the 1950s and 1960s.
Animal to animal, with occasional spill over to humans. Sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented.
The cestode Diphyllobothrium latum (fish or broad tapeworm), the largest human tapeworm (up to 25 meters long). In Japan and eastern Russia D. nihonkaiense is common. At least 13 other Diphyllobothrium species have been reported to infect humans, but less frequently.
Dengue-like fever with headache, malaise, arthralgia or myalgia for about 2 to 5 days; occasionally nausea and vomiting, lower limb weakness, conjunctivitis, photophobia and a rash. The fever resolves in a few days; the disease is non-fatal.
Prevention is focused on eliminating BSE in cattle, preventing infected bovinematerial entering the animal and human food chain, and reducing the risk of secondary transmission to humans in the healthcare setting. To this end many countries have banned bovine meat and bone meal from livestock feed, slaughtered infected herds, and taken other precautions to prevent infected cattle from entering the human food chain. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission of vCJD through blood products include low-risk sourcing and leucodepletion. Further precautionary methods to reduce the risk of transmission through contaminated surgical instruments.
Ivermectin; alternative: albendazole or thiabendazole.
Primary: BCG vaccination of children protects against disseminated disease. Secondary: intensive search for and treatment of source cases; contact investigation and treatment of positive cases with chemoprophylaxis. WHO has established a ‘Stop TB Partnership’ program to control TB world wide.
Fox–rodent–fox (sylvatic cycle). Foxes are the definitive hosts of the adult worm. Eggs are excreted with the feces and ingested by humans or the intermediate rodent host, where they hatch. The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and via the blood they reach the liver, lungs, brain, and heart. There they form metacestodes in which protoscolices develop. When the rodent is eaten by the definitive host, these attach to the small intestine and grow into adult worms. Occasionally wild carnivores (e.g. coyotes or wolves) can be definitive hosts. In some rural areas there is a synanthropic cycle in which dogs or cats are definitive hosts, acquiring the parasite from wild rodents.
The limits of P. falciparum malaria is determined by the presence of vector species and control measures within a certain region. P. falciparum malaria causes approximately 500 million cases each year and around one million deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007 almost 60% of the 2.4 billion people at risk of malaria were living in areas with a stable risk of P. falciparum. High endemicity was most common and widespread in the African region. In the Americas, those at risk were all in the low endemicity class. In Asia 88% are in the low endemicity class, 11% in the intermediate class, and 1% in the high endemicity class. Recent progress is being made by the Global Malaria Action Plan to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality world wide and have a vision for malaria elimination. Ranking countries on the possibility of elimination shows that it is most feasible in the Americas and several countries in Asia and the west Pacific. It is least feasible in Africa, where much of west and central Africa need more than 90% reduction in transmission.
Leptospirosis has a worldwide distribution, is more common in tropical regions where it is both an occupational disease and a disease of ‘daily lives,’ mainly during heavy rainfall. Most foci are found in Latin America and the Caribbean, India, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and eastern Europe. The agent favors warm, humid environments. The prevalence of different serovars depends on the reservoir in which animals are present, local environmental conditions, local occupation, and agricultural practices. Protective measures have decreased the occupational risk in high-risk jobs, like mining, sewermaintenance, farming, veterinary work, and the military. In the tropics, occupational exposures (rice and sugar cane farming, fishing) and other agricultural activities remain an important risk. Leptospirosis is an emerging disease in slums, especially during rainy seasons. Also large recreational events with water exposure can be an important source of big multinational outbreaks.
Larva currens.
The louse-borne agent is responsible for epidemics, with a CFR of 30–70%; tick-borne agents cause endemic disease, with a CFR of 2–10%. LBRF has disappeared from Europe; tick-borne relapsing fever is found world wide, except in Australia and New Zealand, and is rare in Europe and North America. Human TBRF is frequent in endemic areas where people live in close proximity to burrows of reservoir animals. Otherwise, the disease is sporadic. LBRF is now found sporadically in epidemics in Africa, and is associated with refugee camps, natural disasters, and famine. LBRF used to be common world wide with large epidemics during the two world wars. It may re-establish anywhere in louse-infested human populations.
Hendra virus: encephalitis and pneumonia, with a rapid progression to death (few survive). One case recovered from encephalitis but relapsed 14 months later and died with neurologic signs, suggesting latency and recrudescence. Nipah virus: encephalitis and pneumonia. There has been a case of relapse encephalitis more than 4 years after infection. The CFR can vary from 10 to 75%, but is generally high.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), an encapsulated Gram-positive bacterium, with > 90 serotypes based on capsular polysaccharide antigens. Approximately 23 serotypes are responsible for 90% if the infections in the developed world.
Nantucket fever, Piroplasmosis.
No specific treatment is available.
Chronic, painless skin nodule that progresses to a severe,deforming ulcer. One-third of early nodules heal spontaneously. Most nodules appear on limbs, but also face and breast; skin lesions may also appear as plaques or indurated edematous lesions; osteomyelitis. Typical characteristic is the presence of deeply undermined ulcers. Sequelae include contracture, deformity, and permanent disability.
