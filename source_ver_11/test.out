Mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito. There is an enzootic cycle, mainly between C. taralsis and passerine birds. There is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits. Viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds. Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days.

RVFV primarily causes disease in animals in Africa and Middle East, with human cases occurring during animal epidemics. RVF was initially confined to Sub-Saharan Africa, but appeared in Egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia and Yemen) in 2000 and later also on the Comoros Islands.

Junin virus is spread annually around harvest time by rodents to farmers. The range of Junin virus is extending to the north, putting an estimated 5 million people at risk. The other viruses are brought into villages and houses by peridomestic rodents, causing sporadic outbreaks with intervals of several years. Pathogenicity of Whitewater Arroyo virus remains to be confirmed since there was no virus isolation from the Californian cases.

Hib is a common invasive bacterial infection that primarily causes pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia. Hib meningitis may present acutely or subacutely with fever, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and a bulging fontanelle in infants or a stiff neck in older children. Hib may also cause epiglottitis, which presents with fever, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing, talking and breathing.
