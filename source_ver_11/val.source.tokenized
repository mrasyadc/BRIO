By animal bite through saliva commonly or scratch -LRB- rarely -RRB- . Infected livestock do not bite typically , but may infect a person through their saliva . Very rare : licks upon mucosal surfaces ; aerosols in bat-infested caves ; person-toperson transmission via organ/tissue transplantation . Rabies can be transmitted via slaughtering of infected reservoir species , for instance dogs in countries where dogs are consumed .
Demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in Giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy ; PCR tests have been developed for the different Leishmania species ; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience . The Montenegro skin test is simple , sensitive and specific , but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections .

Consumption of raw or undercooked vector molluscs , infested vegetables or vegetable juice , or other fresh water related food .
Tetanus is globally distributed but is more common in highly populated agricultural areas , and in warm and wet regions . In the late 1980s tetanus was estimated to cause around 1 million deaths per year , mostly in newborn infants . The current distribution of cases represents the coverage of tetanus immunization in children and adults . In countries with good vaccine coverage in children , adult cases may still be common , as natural immunity plays no role in the epidemiology of tetanus . The DTP3 Vaccination Coverage map shows coverage with the third dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine in childhood . The elimination of neonatal tetanus was set as a goal in 1989 and by mid2010 neonatal tetanus had been eliminated in 79 % -LRB- 153/193 -RRB- of WHO Member States . However , since C. tetani will always remain present in nature , tetanus will always remain a threat , and high levels of immunization must be maintained indefinitely .
Tularemia has six characteristic clinical syndromes , depending on the site of infection : ulceroglandular -LRB- commonest -RRB- , glandular , oropharyngeal , pneumonic , oculoglandular , and typhoidal . Clinical signs include sudden onset of high fever , chills , generalized aches , and chronic ulcer at the bite site -LRB- ulceroglandular -RRB- . From the primary site , lymphatic spread to regional lymphnodes . Further hematogeneous dissemination to other organs . CFR for Type A -LRB- ulcero -RRB- glandular disease is < 2 % if treated promptly -LRB- 5 to 30 % if not treated -RRB- . In the acute septic form -LRB- typhoidal -RRB- of the disease , lymphadenopathy and ulcer are absent , and the CFR is high -LRB- 30 -- 60 % -RRB- . Oculoglandular disease is rare . Ingestion of infected material may result in oropharyngeal or GI tularemia . In the oropharyngeal form signs are : throat pain , large tonsils , pseudomembrane , and enlarged cervical lymph nodes . Symptoms in GI tularemia range from mild persistent diarrhea to extensive intestinal ulcers and death . Pneumonic tularemia occurs after inhalation of bacteria , or secondary from other entry sites and may progress to severe pneumonia , respiratory failure , and death .
Piscivorous -LRB- fish-eating -RRB- mammals , including : humans , dogs , cats , pigs , rats , and several species of wild animals . Humans can remain infected for several decades .
Enteric fever , typhus abdominalis .
Detection of virus in respiratory specimens , stool or blood by RT-PCR ; virus isolation ; serology by IFA or ELISA . Specimen processing and testing should be performed under strict biosafety measures -LRB- BSL-3 -RRB- .
The highest global burden of CL is in the Old World . In the Americas , Bolivia , Brazil , and Peru have the highest burden of CL . In the New World , CL mainly occurs in forested areas , whereas in the Old World it is associated with semi-arid and desert regions . Transmision can also occur in deforested areas . Disease mainly occurs in those living or working in the forests of endemic areas . Outbreaks can occur during military training in the jungle or infrastructural projetcs in endemic areas . Also , travelers acquire the disease during visits to rural or jungle regions . Disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus , likely due to acquired immunity . Clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households , which is probably related to the short flight range of sandflies .
Pulmonary distomiasis , lung fluke disease
Mumps is preventable by the use of live attenuated mumps virus vaccines . Various vaccine strains are available and may vary in immunogenicity and the incidence of adverse effects , such as fever , rash , parotitis , or meningitis .
Rodent to rodent with spill over to humans in case of adequate exposure .
Approximately 15 to 20 million people worldwide are believed to be infected . In Africa all HTLV and STLV subtypes are found , and phylogenetic research suggest that HTLV-1 originated in Africa about 27,000 years ago . HTLV-1 infection is more common in women and the prevalence increases with age , with a peak incidence around age 50 . Among HTLV-1 carriers , the lifetime risk of developing HAM/TSP ranges from between 0.3 % and 4 % . For ATL , this risk is estimated to be 1 % to 5 % and for HTLV-1-associated diseases in general , including ATL , HAM/TSP , uveitis , polymyositis and arthropathy , the lifetime risk may be close to 10 % . Japan , Africa , Caribbean islands and South America are the areas of highest prevalence , but the reasons for this are unknown . Most infections world wide are due to subtype HTLV-1a . Distribution of the infection is focal , e.g. Brazil , Japan , and Iran , where HTLV-1 is limited to certain areas of each country . On several Japanese islands the prevalence can reach 37 % . Socioeconomic or genetic factors may contribute to the development of HTLV-associated infective dermatitis , since the disease has not been reported in HTLV-1 epidemic Japan . For non-endemic areas such as Europe and North America , HTLV-1 infection is mainly found in immigrants from endemic areas , their offspring and sexual contacts , among sex workers and IVDUs .
Supportive .
Direct transmission via skin to skin or oral contact -LRB- also via sharing drinking and eating utensils -RRB- . Sharing of drinking vessels plays an important role in transmission of endemic syphilis in arid regions . There is little or no mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy .

Hepatitis C virus -LRB- HCV -RRB- is an enveloped RNA virus -LRB- hepacavirus -RRB- and belongs to theflaviviruses . The HCV genome is highly mutable . There are at least six HCV genotypes and several subtypes with differences in clinical presentation , geographic distribution and treatment response . HCV was discovered in 1989 as another cause of transfusion associated hepatitis -LRB- non-A non-B hepatitis -RRB- .
Self-limiting disease . Sudden onset of joint pain ; fatigue , marked arthralgia and myalgia in more than 40 % , stiff and swollen joints in 60 -- 85 % of cases ; anorexia , headache , back pain , photophobia , sore throat , lethargy , and lymphadenopathy also occur , with fever and a maculopapular rash , usually on the trunk and limbs but also on palms and soles , in 50 % of cases . Relapses occur ; joint pains and swelling may relapse for as long as 6 years . Patients eventually recover completely .
B. quintana multiplies in the louse 's intestine and is excreted in the feces . Body lice feed several times per day that leads to itchiness and scratching , by which the skin is inoculated with louses ' contaminated feces . Chronic B. quintana bacteremia facilitates infection in lice and further spread .
Personal anti-mosquito precautions ; vector control ; screening blood and transplant products . There is no vaccine approved for human use . There are several veterinary vaccines .
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown . Antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign , or misdiagnosed and underreported . Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide , mainly during the rainy season . Cases have been reported in dryer areas , like northeastern Brazil and north Iran . This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields . In Southeast Asia , it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water . In northeast Thailand , 20 % of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis , which accounts for 39 % of fatal septicemias and 36 % of fatal community-acquired pneumonias . Up to 80 % of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes , chronic renal disease , or alcoholism , age , chronic infection , or immunosuppressive therapy . Sporadic human infections with glanders -LRB- B. mallei -RRB- , occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists , horse butchers , and laboratory workers .

Eggs are highly sensitive to elevated temperatures and desiccation , but survive for months at freezing temperatures and are not affected by common disinfectants or ethanol .
PCR on blood or skin biopsy , or IFA on the latter . Serology is unspecific due to cross-reactivity .
WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 . Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds . Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999 , WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world . Since the introduction to northeast America , the virus has spread to most regions in North America , Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and several cases in South America . The national average annual incidence of neuroinvasive disease in the USA during 1999 to 2008 was 0.40 per 100,000 population -LRB- range : 0.01 -- 1.02 -RRB- . In that time period in the USA , 28,961 cases were confirmed , including 1,131 deaths . Neuroinvasive disease incidence is higher among males , especially among persons aged 60 years . The highest incidence of neuroinvasive disease occurredin theWest Central and Mountain regions , probably resulting from the high efficiency of Cx . tarsalis as both an epizootic and epidemic WNV vector in those areas . Most US cases occur in the late summer , when Culex mosquitoes are more active and after WNV amplification in the bird reservoir . In warm climates year-round transmission is seen .
Surgical extraction of adult worms from the eye . Diethylcarbamazine -LRB- DEC -RRB- is filaricidal but can cause SAEs in patients with heavy infection . SAEs can be reduced by coadministering antihistamines or steroids . Alternative : albendazole with a lower risk of SAEs in case of heavy infection .
Typical skin ulcer , eschar , may develop at the site of the mite 's bite . Several days later fever , headache , myalgia , and lymphadenopathy may develop . Dry cough with signs of pneumonitis , jaundice , and meningoencepahlitis may occur . Scrub typhus severity and clinical presentation is probably strain dependent .
Clean wounds , perform debridement and remove foreign objects . A one-off dose of im or iv human tetanus immunoglobulin removes unbound toxin but does not affect bound toxin . Metronidazole in large doses for 7 -- 14 days to eradicate C. tetani infection . Since the effect of bound toxin may last for 4 -- 6 weeks , prolonged supportive care is required . Tetanus does not induce immunity . Vaccination with tetanus toxoid is therefore indicated during treatment .
Common presenting symptoms are : influenza-like symptoms -LRB- fever , dry cough , chills , myalgia -RRB- , headache , malaise , anorexia , nausea , abdominal discomfort with abdominal tenderness , coated tongue , and hepatosplenomegaly . Adults may have constipation , while young children and HIV patients more often have diarrhea . In 5 -- 30 % a rash is present on the abdomen and chest . Children < 5 years regularly have unspecific symptoms and remain undiagnosed . Complications occur in 10 -- 15 % , including GI bleeding -LRB- most common -RRB- , intestinal perforation , and typhoid encephalopathy . CFR is approximately 2 % -LRB- range : Common presenting symptoms are : influenza-like symptoms -LRB- fever , dry cough , chills , myalgia -RRB- , headache , malaise , anorexia , nausea , abdominal discomfort with abdominal tenderness , coated tongue , and hepatosplenomegaly . Adults may have constipation , while young children and HIV patients more often have diarrhea . In 5 -- 30 % a rash is present on the abdomen and chest . Children < 5 years regularly have unspecific symptoms and remain undiagnosed . Complications occur in 10 -- 15 % , including GI bleeding -LRB- most common -RRB- , intestinal perforation , and typhoid encephalopathy .

Hantaviruses , a large group of different , enveloped , single-stranded , negative-sense viruses with a tripartite RNA genome , that belong to the Bunyaviridae family . Hantaviruses are named after the Hantan River area in South Korea , where the first hantavirus -LRB- Hantaan -RRB- was isolated in the 1970s . Old World and New World hantaviruses share high similarity in their genome and have comparable life cycles . Currently , there is no consensus on the classification of hantaviruses . Old World hantaviruses shown on the map are : Dobrava -- Belgrade virus -LRB- DOBV -RRB- , Hantaan virus -LRB- HTNV -RRB- , Puumula virus -LRB- PUUV -RRB- , and Saaremaa virus -LRB- SAAV -RRB- . Seoul virus -LRB- SEOV -RRB- is not shown , it is world wide in major port cities .
None .
Pig-to-pig , with occasional spill-over to humans .
C. burnetii is resistant to many disinfectants and extreme environmental conditions . The organism can survive in aerosols for 2 weeks and in soil up to 5 months . Prevention is targeted to those working with livestock , mainly sheep and goats ; appropriate disposal of birth products ; routine testing of risk animals ; restricted movement of animals in infected regions ; culling of infected animals ; a human and veterinary vaccine is available in several countries ; pasteurize milk .
Rubella virus , a single-stranded RNA positive-sense rubivirus of the family Togaviridae .
For LBRF , humans ; for TBRF , wild rodents , bats and ticks -LRB- by trans-stadial and transovarian transmission -RRB- . B. duttonii has thus far not been detected in wild animals , only in humans and tick vector O. moubata . Livestock may also become infected .
Consumption , white plague , TB .
It is estimated that 37 million people are infected worldwide , 97 % of them in Africa , and remaining in small foci in Central and South America and Yemen . Onchocerciasis was imported into Latin America by the slave trade . Onchocerciasis prevalence is related to the proximity to riverine breeding sites of black flies , with the highest disease burden in communities adjacent to rivers . Prevalence of infection rises with age until around 20 years , after which infection profiles vary between geographical region and sex . Higher rates of morbidity are reported in men . This variation canbe explainedby heterogeneity in age , gender , and occupational exposure to vectors .
None .
Humans are viremic at a titer high enough to infect mosquitoes for 3 to 7 days post illness onset . The virus travels from the mosquito gut to the salivary glands in 5 -- 7 days , after which it can infect another human by bite .
Anti-mosquito precautions ; there is no vaccine available .
Microscopy to detect microfilariae in finger-prick blood smears ; immunochromatic test cards ; ultrasound to locate ` nests . '
Through contamination of penetrating wounds -LRB- e.g. by thorns , splinters -RRB- . There is no person-to-person transmission .
Polyarthritis and rash , epidemic polyarthritis , Barmah Forest virus disease , and Ross River virus disease , Murweh virus disease .
Tabanid adult female flies , mainly Chrysops silacea , C. dimidiata , and C. distinctipennis . These day-biting and bloodsucking flies breed in forested and damp environments -LRB- e.g. swamps or rotten vegetation -RRB- . Other favorable environments are cocoa plantations . Chrysops are attracted by movement , dark objects , and smoke . The vector does not enter structures like homes or barns . Up to 18 % of the vector population can be infected with L. loa in endemic areas .
In 1988 , the WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative -LRB- GPEI -RRB- . The Americas were certified polio-free in 1994 , the WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 and Europe in 2002 -LRB- in 2010 , there was importation of polio into Europe -RRB- . The GPEI has four main strategies to stop transmission of the wild poliovirus : -LRB- 1 -RRB- high infant immunization coverage with four doses of oral poliovirus vaccine -LRB- OPV -RRB- in the first year of life ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- supplementary doses of OPV to all children under 5 years of age during SIAs ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- surveillance for wild poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing of all acute flaccid paralysis -LRB- AFP -RRB- cases among children under 15 years of age ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- targeted campaigns once wild poliovirus transmission is limited to a specific focal area . To be certified polio-free , three conditions must be met : -LRB- 1 -RRB- there are at least 3 years of zero polio cases due to wild poliovirus ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- disease surveillance efforts in countries meet international standards ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- each country must illustrate the capacity to detect , report , and respond to ` imported ' polio cases . Oral live attenuated polio vaccines can give rise to circulation of vaccinederived polioviruses and rare cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis . For this reason , efforts are underway to develop affordable options for inactivated polio vaccination .
Sudden onset fever , frontal headache , backache , diarrhea and a rash ; usually resolves without sequelae ; fatalities are rare and the result of hemorrhage or meningoencephalitis . ILEV and NRIV can cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks . CVV rarely causes encephalitis , with only one fatal case reported in the USA in 1995 .
