A generally mild and short-lived illness with fever , coryza , conjunctivitis , lymphadenopathy , and a fine maculopapular rash beginning on the face later spreading to the trunks and limbs . Postauricular , occipital or posterior cervical lymphadenopathy may precede the rash by 5 -- 10 days . Around half of rubella infections are subclinical and constitutional symptoms may be minimal in children . Arthropathy may occur , especially in young women . The most important clinical consequence of rubella is congenital rubella syndrome -LRB- CRS -RRB- , which may result from intra-uterine infection in thefirst 16 weeks of pregnancy . CRS is a severe disease characterized by deafness , cataract , cardiac abnormalities , and a range of neurological impairments .
The incidence of Noma and the prevalence of survivors of Noma are not well known . In 1998 , WHO estimated that 770,000 people had been affected in the past and survived the affection , and that 140,000 new cases were reported each year , of which 100,000 were between 1 and 7 years old and living in Sub-Saharan Africa . An estimation of the global incidence based on epidemiological field work in north-west Nigeria indicates 30,000 to 40,000 new cases per year . It occurs predominantly in debilitated and malnourished children , especially in underdeveloped countries . Peak incidence is at age 1 -- 4 years , the period of growth retardation in deprived children . The etiology is multifactorial : malnutrition , concurrent infections with malaria or measles , bad oral hygiene , severe diarrhea and severe necrotic ulcerative gingivitis are risk factors . In developed countries sporadic cases occur in immune-compromised patients , neonates , HIV-positive and diabetic patients .

90 % of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic ; 10 % develop invasive-intestinal disease -LRB- colitis -RRB- , and < 1 % extra-intestinal disease -LRB- liver abscess -RRB- . Amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps , weight loss , and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea ; most patients are afebrile . Amebic colitis rarely progresses to necrotizing colitis , ameboma , and toxic megacolon . Amebic colitis affects children and adults equally , but mainly males . Amebic liver-abscess mainly occurs in men aged 18 to 50 years , for unknown reasons . E. moshkovskii can cause non-invasive diarrhea .
For C. philippinensis : fish-eating birds . Freshwater fish are intermediate hosts .
Mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito . There is an enzootic cycle , mainly between C. taralsis and passerine birds . There is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits . Viremia lasts 2 -- 5 days in birds . Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days . Humans and horses are dead-end hosts for WEEV because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes .
Transmission to humans occurs by rubbing infected louse feces into abraded skin or into the conjunctivae .

LFV was isolated from a missionary nurse living in Lassa , Nigeria , in 1969 . It is estimated there are 200,000 to 300,000 symptomatic Lassa fever cases in West Africa each year , with an associated mortality of 5,000 to 10,000 . Lassa fever occurs in two geographically distinct regions : the Mano River region -LRB- Guinea , Sierra Leone , Liberia -RRB- in the West , and Nigeria in the East . In the dry season , the multi-mammate rat gathers in houses , and in the rainy season , the rat forages in the surrounding fields . Villages with Lassa fever are all located in rain forest areas or transition zones of rainforest to savannah , where the mean annual rainfall is above 1,500 mm and below 3,000 mm . LFV can be transmitted from rodents to humans both in the rainy and the dry season . However , in the dry season there may be an increased risk for humans due to aggregation of the rats in their houses .

Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa , where it is estimated that 12 -- 13 million humans are infected . The prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age , and is more common in men as they are more exposed . Loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control . It has been proposed that areas where the Loiasis prevalence is > 20 % , are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment .
None .
Supportive care ; ribavirin iv is effective if given within the first 6 days after infection . There is no vaccine .
Wild , migratory birds of the order Passeriformes -LRB- mainlyfieldfare , redwing , and songthrush -RRB- and Anseriformes -LRB- ducks , geese and swans -RRB- . Tetraonid birds -LRB- grouse -RRB- population size changes coincide with SINV epidemics in Finland . Larger passerine species have higher prevalences of infection as compared to smaller species .
Humans . Loa loa also infects some monkeys but the human and simian cycles seem to be independent .
RVFV primarily causes disease in animals in Africa and Middle East , with human cases occurring during animal epidemics . Humans that regularly work with animals -LRB- farmers , herders , veterinarians , slaughterhouse workers -RRB- are at increased risk of infection . Epidemics in animals occur when mosquito populations dramatically increase after periods of heavy rainfall or the production of wetlands behind man-made dams . RVF was initially confined to Sub-Saharan Africa , but appeared in Egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the Arabian Peninsula -LRB- Saudi Arabia and Yemen -RRB- in 2000 and later also on the Comoros Islands . As RVFV epidemics are closely associated with above-average rainfall , outbreaks can be forecasted upon which preventive measures can be implemented .
Junin virus is spread annually around harvest time by rodents to farmers . The range of Junin virus is extending to the north , putting an estimated 5 million people at risk . The other viruses are brought into villages and houses by peridomestic rodents , causing sporadic outbreaks with intervals of several years . Deforestation and human invasion into rodent habitat may have resulted in increased human exposure to infected rodents and a concomitant increase in human illnesses -LRB- see Forest Cover map -RRB- . Only single cases of an infection by Sabia and Chapare viruses have been recorded . Pathogenicity of Whitewater Arroyo virus remains to be confirmed since there was no virus isolation from the Californian cases .
Supportive , there is no specific treatment .

Among those infected , about 20 % develop acute watery diarrhea , of which 10 -- 20 % develop severe watery diarrhea with vomiting , leading to severe dehydration which may be lethal if not treated . The CFR is typically below 5 % , but in crowded refugee camps it can run as high as 50 % .
Half of the infected patients are asymptomatic and those with symptoms usually have mild disease . The most common presentations of acute Q fever are pneumonia , hepatitis , and isolated fever . Other symptoms are neurological -LRB- headache , confusion , peripheral neuropathy -RRB- , sore throat , chills , sweats , rash , and non-productive cough . Proportion of people presenting with pneumonia or hepatitis varies by region and immune status . CFR : 1 -- 2 % . Chronic Q fever occurs 1 to 20 years after acute infection and most often presents as endocarditis in patients with pre-existing heart disease -LRB- valve abnormality -RRB- .
Hib is a common invasive bacterial infection that primarily causes pneumonia , meningitis , and bacteremia . Pneumonia due to Hib is clinically indistinguishable from other causes of bacterial pneumonia . Hib meningitis may present acutely or subacutely with fever , vomiting , lethargy , irritability , and a bulging fontanelle in infants or a stiff neck in older children . Bacteremia may be present with meningitis or pneumonia but may also occur without an obvious focus of infection . Hib may also cause epiglottitis , which presents with fever , sore throat , and difficulty swallowing , talking and breathing . Infections of soft tissue , bones , and joints with H. influenzae may occur .
Blister , usually on the leg or foot , which burns or itches , fever , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , dyspnea , dizziness and generalized urticaria . Multiple and repeat infections occur , there is no protective immunity . Painful and infected ulcers can incapacitate patients for months .
