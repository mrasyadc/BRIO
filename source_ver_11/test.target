By tick bites, ingestion of uncooked, parasitized aquatic hosts
Mebendazole or albendazole; radical surgical excision.
By arthropod bite handling or processing of infected animal carcasses or tissues, by ingestion of contaminated water, soil or food, or by inhalation of contaminated dust or aerosols.
Aquatic insects;
Detection of viral RNA in blood by RTPCR
Dust control where feasible (e.g. paving roads). Screening of organ donors for coccidioidomycosis in endemic areas.
Spherical, enveloped, negative sense RNA viruses forming a subgroup of the Bunyaviridae family.
Contamination of a break in the skin by bacilli in the environment, or by the bite of an infected aquatic insect or mosquito.
Yersinia pestis
Simian variola.
The diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical features
None.
Rodent–rodent, with humans as accidental dead-end hosts. Infected reservoir hosts are asymptomatic and excrete infectious virus in the urine.
A generally mild and short-lived illness with fever, coryza, conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and a fine maculopapular rash beginning on the face later spreading to the trunks and limbs.
The incidence of Noma and the prevalence of survivors of Noma are not well known. In developed countries sporadic cases occur in immune-compromised patients, neonates, HIV-positive and diabetic patients.
Rodent control; avoid close contact with reservoir animals; prophylaxis with penicillin or doxycycline following rat bite.
FA staining of frozen skin sections taken from the nape of the neck, or postmortem brain tissue
By tick bite, blood transfusion; bone marrow for transplantation is routinely screened
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a non-enveloped singlestranded RNA virus, genus Hepevirus, the single member in the Hepeviridae family. 
Isolation of C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans by culture and toxigenicity testing of strains at reference labs.
Sanitation to reduce contamination of vector snail habitat, together with mass treatment with praziquantel and health education.
Serology (HEV IgM, IgG); HEV RNA detection in blood and stool by RT-PCR.
Environment (soil) to human.
90% of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic; 10% develop invasive-intestinal disease (colitis), and <1% extra-intestinal disease (liver abscess). Amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps, weight loss, and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea
For C. philippinensis: fish-eating birds. Freshwater fish are intermediate hosts.
Mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito. There is an enzootic cycle, mainly between C. taralsis and passerine birds. There is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits. Viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds. Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days.
Transmission to humans occurs by rubbing infected louse feces
Most commonly, the urban container-breeding, daybitingmosquitoesAedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus
Rarely by tick bite.
Mainly humans; rarely non-human primates and other mammals.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
LFV was isolated from a missionary nurse living in Lassa, Nigeria, in 1969. 
rhabdovirus
Ticks of the genera Amblyomma and Ixodes.
Streptobacillus moniliformis
Humans are viremic at a titer high enough to infect mosquitoes for up to 5 days after infection.
Cutaneous anthrax: penicillin, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline po; severe anthrax (GI or inhalation): ciprofloxacin iv preferred. Clindamycin can inhibit toxin production.
SARS
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus
Deworming with mebendazole or albendazole;
Anti-mosquito precautions.
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa
None.
Supportive care; ribavirin iv is effective if given within the first 6 days after infection. There is no vaccine.
Wild
Humans.
RVFV primarily causes disease in animals in Africa and Middle East, with human cases occurring during animal epidemics. RVF was initially confined to Sub-Saharan Africa, but appeared in Egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia and Yemen) in 2000 and later also on the Comoros Islands.
Junin virus is spread annually around harvest time by rodents to farmers. The range of Junin virus is extending to the north, putting an estimated 5 million people at risk. The other viruses are brought into villages and houses by peridomestic rodents, causing sporadic outbreaks with intervals of several years. Pathogenicity of Whitewater Arroyo virus remains to be confirmed since there was no virus isolation from the Californian cases.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Lagomorphs and rodents (ground squirrels). Aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats), hares and small rodents
Humans are the only natural host
acute watery diarrhea, severe watery diarrhea with vomiting, leading to severe dehydration
pneumonia, hepatitis, and isolated fever. neurological (headache, confusion, peripheral neuropathy), sore throat, chills, sweats, rash, and non-productive cough.
primarily causes pneumonia, meningitis, and bacteremia. Hib meningitis may present acutely or subacutely with fever, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, and a bulging fontanelle in infants or a stiff neck in older children
Blister,usually on the leg or foot,which burns or itches, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, dizziness and generalized urticaria.
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control, disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas.
Chinese liver fluke, Oriental liver fluke.
South American blastomycosis, Brazilian blastomycosis, Lutz–Splendore–Almeida disease.
