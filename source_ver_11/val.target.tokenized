WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 . Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds . Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999 , WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world . Since the introduction to northeast America , the virus has spread to most regions in North America , Canada , Mexico , the Caribbean and several cases in South America .
