Infections are most frequent in a period of drought and winds (dust storms) after heavy rains that advance mold growth, usually late summer or early fall. It is estimated that more than 150,000 primary infections occur annually in the USA. Infections outside the western hemisphere are extremely rare and primarily imported.

CHIKV has been endemic in Africa for centuries, typically causing small epidemics in rural areas. In 2005–2006 CHIKV spread from East Africa to virgin soil in the Indian Ocean Islands to produce epidemics affecting up to three-quarters of the population. CHIKV virus was imported into several European countries and caused a small outbreak with autochthonous transmission in northern Italy.

It is epidemic in temperate parts of Asia, linked to the seasonal occurrence of mosquitoes, and endemic in tropical regions of Asia due to the year-round mosquito activity. The range of JE virus has recently expanded into the Torres Strait of northern Australia, but the disease is rare in western Pacific islands.

ONNV is a mutant of CHIKV that appeared in 1959 in Uganda and was spread by anopheline mosquitoes across the malaria belt of Africa, leading to a large mosquitoborne virus epidemic. There was a small outbreak in Côte d’Ivoire in 1984–1985 and again in 2003, also described as Igbo-Ora virus and a small recurrence in Uganda in 1996. Serological evidence suggested its presence in humans in Kenya in 1994–1995 and in horses in Nigeria, but serological tests are subject to cross-reactions with CHIKV antibody.

SINV has been isolated from Africa, Eurasia, and Australia. The highest disease burden is in northern Europe (approximately between 60 and 64 N) and South Africa. Evolutionary studies show that SINV likely originated from South America, with subsequent spread to North America, Asia, and Australia, with later spread to Europe and Africa. Highest attack rates in Finland are in the eastern parts, and mainly in the age group 45 to 65 years. Epidemics tend to occur every 7 years in Finland, with the last epidemic in 2002.

Eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies, mature in about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on water temperature, and hatch ciliated larvae (coracidia). Coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans (copepods). The copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host, typically small fish. The larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae.

The illness begins with a prodrome of fever, malaise, and headache followed by unilateral or, more commonly, bilateral tender swelling of the parotid (parotitis) or other salivary glands. Parotitis is present in 95% of clinical cases. Infection and inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) occurs in up to 30% of adult males but is rare before puberty. Orchitis results in testicular atrophy in 50% of cases but rarely causes sterility. Adult women may rarely suffer inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis). The commonest nervous system manifestation of mumps infection is meningitis. Other rarer clinical complications include hearing loss, encephalitis, and pancreatitis. Mumps infection in early pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion.

Echinococcosis is restricted to the northern hemisphere, and is most commonly found in adults. In some areas there is a shift from a sylvatic to a synantropic cycle, including domestic dogs, as was seen in China and Alaska. Such a shift leads to a higher risk of infection in humans. The prevalence in dogs and cats is still very low in Europe, even in areas highly endemic for infection in foxes.

In the absence of vaccination, Hib is commonly carried in the nose and throats of healthy individuals and almost all children are exposed to Hib by the age of 5. Ten countries, all in Africa and Asia, accounted for an estimated 61% of all these Hib deaths.

MPV is endemic in heavily forested areas of Africa, primarily of low altitude and high humidity. Comparison of active surveillance data in one health zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo from the 1980s (0.72 per 10,000) and 2006–2007 (14.5 per 10,000) suggests a 20-fold increase in human monkeypox incidence 30 years after mass smallpox vaccination ceased in that country. In 2003, multiple cases of monkeypox occurred across the USA among persons who had contact with the excretions of sick prairie dogs (native ground squirrels) either at a child-care center or from pet stores.
