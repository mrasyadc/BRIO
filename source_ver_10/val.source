Mainly humans; rarely domestic animals. Humans can be short-term carriers after an infection (10%) or become chronic carriers in the biliary tract (1–5%), shedding viable bacteria in the stool. Chronic carriers are mainly adults with pre-existingbiliary tractpathology.Urinary carriagemay occur in areas where Schistosoma haematobium is endemic.
Cat liver fluke disease, foodborne trematodiasis
Ancylostomiasis, Necatoriasis, Uncinariasis, ground itch.
None.
Argentinian (Junin virus), Bolivian (Machupo virus), Brazilian (Sabia virus), and Venezuelan (Guanarito virus) hemorrhagic fevers.
Larva currens.
Herbivores become infected when they ingest spores during grazing on contaminated soil. When the animal dies, the soil under the carcase is contaminated. Omnivores and carnivores are infected by feeding on infected prey or carcases. Carnivores and humans are incidental hosts.
The primary vectors are ticks and biting flies (deer flies, tabanids). In central Europe: Dermacentor reticulatus and Ixodes ricinus are important vectors. In eastern USA, D. variabilis is the most important vector. In western USA, biting flies are the predominant vectors in arid regions. In Russia, transmission is both by ticks (Ixodes) and mosquitoes.
The dimorphic fungi: Histoplasma capsulatum (worldwide) and H. capsulatum var. duboisii (Africa). The fungi grow as a mycelium in the soil at ambient temperatures and convert to the yeast form in the lung at body temperature.
Strongyloides stercoralis, a minute nematode roundworm (up to2.2 mmlong). S.fuelleborni (not shown on the map) is a less common agent and can causehuman diseasein Africa and Papua New Guinea (‘swollen belly syndrome’ in infants).
Intestinal capillariasis is generally found in countries where raw freshwater fish is eaten. The parasite was first reported in 1963 in the northern Philippines. C. philippinensisis endemic in the Philippines, Laos, and Thailand. Rare cases have been reported from other Asian countries and the Middle East. A single case has been reported in Spain imported from Colombia, but there are no other reports of cases in the Americas. Rare cases of human infection with C. hepatica and C. aerophila have been reportedworldwide. Infected fishmay be exported from endemic areas to non-endemic countries.
Personal protection from sandfly bites (e.g. protective clothing, insecticide-treated bednets, residual insecticiding of breeding places).
The detection of virus in saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, or seminal fluid by culture or RT-PCR. Detection of mumps specific IgM or significant rise in antibody titer in paired samples.
Human monocytic ehrlichioses (HME), human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), Sennetsu fever.
IgM capture or IgG ELISAs is most commonly used on paired acute and convalescent sera. Virus isolation in suckling mice or cell culture and identified by RT-PCR.
WNV was cultured for the first time from a woman with a fever of unknown origin in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. Molecular studies suggest that WNV emerged in Africa and spread through migrating waterbirds. Until the introduction of WNV in New York in 1999, WNV infections usually caused mild disease outbreaks and episodes of neuroinvasive disease in the old world. Since the introduction to northeast America, the virus has spread to most regions in North America, Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and several cases in South America. The national average annual incidence of neuroinvasive disease in the USA during 1999 to 2008 was 0.40 per 100,000 population (range: 0.01–1.02). In that time period in the USA, 28,961 cases were confirmed, including 1,131 deaths. Neuroinvasive disease incidence is higher among males, especially among persons aged 60 years. The highest incidence of neuroinvasive disease occurredin theWest Central and Mountain regions, probably resulting from the high efficiency of Cx. tarsalis as both an epizootic and epidemic WNV vector in those areas. Most US cases occur in the late summer, when Culex mosquitoes are more active and after WNV amplification in the bird reservoir. In warm climates year-round transmission is seen.
Light microscopy of Giemsa stained thick and thin blood smears; rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) based on immunochromatography on blood; PCR.
Demonstration of intracellular amastigotes in Giemsa stained slit skin smear or biopsy specimen by microscopy; PCR tests have been developed for the different Leishmania species; culture of promastigotes with special media is laborious and requires experience. The Montenegro skin test is simple, sensitive and specific, but does not aid in differentiating between past and present infections.
Taenia solium infection, neurocysticercosis, cerebral cysticercosis, taeniosis, taeniasis.
WHO estimates that 50,000 to 70,000 people are infected each year, with about 60 million people at risk in 36 countries. The disease distribution is limited by the range of the tsetse fly vector. Cases outside the tsetse fly distribution are likely imported. The disease distribution is patchy, with discrete foci and little to no disease between these foci. It is a disease of poverty and mainly occurs in remote rural areas. African trypanosomiasis was close to eradication through a variety of control programs, a loosening of these control programs caused the disease to reemerge in the 1980s. However, recent disease control programs are reversing this trend. The chronic gambiense form in West and Central Africa accounts for 95% of cases and is seperated from rhodesiense by the Great Rift Valley. Uganda is the sole country reporting both forms, with rhodesiense in the south and gambiense in the northwest.
Control deer population; avoid areas with ticks; tick bite precautions: cover skin, repellent on skin and clothing (permethrin, DEET), check daily for attached ticks and remove.
Bunyamwera group viruses are enveloped, singlestranded, RNA viruses genus Orthobunyavirus of the family Bunyaviridae (see also Bunyavirus Group C map). Bunyamwera group viruses that can cause human disease in Africa are: Bunyamwera group viruses are enveloped, singlestranded, RNA viruses genus Orthobunyavirus of the family
Less than 1% of infections result in acute flaccid paralysis, with around 90% of infections being subclinical. In 10% symptoms may include fever, malaise, headache, neck stiffness, pain in the limbs, nausea, and vomiting. Paralysis persists in 0.1–1.0% depending on the virulence of the strain. The flaccid paralysis is usually asymmetric and in one leg. The risk of paralysis is increased by intramuscular injections, immune-compromised state, trauma or surgery (tonsillectomy), and intense physical activity during the incubation period. Also adults are at greater risk of developing paralysis than young children. Aseptic meningitis occurs in around 1% of infections. More severe paralysis with quadriplegia and breathing problems (bulbar polio) may occur.
Serology (IgM ELISA, IFA of erythrocytes). Diagnosis is confirmed by a significant ( > 4-fold) change in antibody titer between acute and convalescent sera. Virus isolation or RNA detection by RT-PCR from the blood or CSF.
Microscopic identification of eggs in the stool, visualization of proglottids passed in the stool.
Rodent–rodent, with humans as accidental dead-end hosts. Infected reservoir hosts are asymptomatic and excrete infectious virus in the urine.
High fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, cough, maculopapular rash beginning on the face, spreading downwards to reach the hands and feet. Characteristic small white spots (Koplik spots) on the buccal mucosa. Complications may consist of otitis media, pneumonia, laryngotracheal bronchitis (croup), blindness, severe skin infections, severe diarrhea and encephalitis, sometimes fatal. Complications are more common and more severe in people with malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, and chronic diseases. Very rarely, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis may appear years later.
Bilharziasis, snail fever, Katayama fever or syndrome, intestinal schistosomiasis.
Mosquitoes. The main vector of enzootic VEEV is the Culex (Melanoconion) spp. (Spissipes group). During VEEV outbreaks, Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus is often the main vector in coastal regions. Epizootic/epidemic subtypes of VEEV are transmitted by mosquitoes of many different genera.
Aquatic insects; in southern Australia mosquitoes; not yet fully understood.
Hendra virus: manage contact between fruit bats and horse by basic husbandry measures such as placing food and water points under cover, regulate movement of horses from areas where the disease is occurring, regulate import of horses from Australia during outbreaks. Nipah virus: avoid contact with fruit bats and their discharges; wash and peel fruit, and wash hands before and after preparing fruit; regulate importation of pigs from outbreak areas.
Avoid tick bites, use repellent on skin and repellent or acaricide on clothing, check body daily for ticks after exposure, boil or pasteurize milk from cows, sheep, and goats in endemic areas. An inactivated vaccine is available. Specific hyperimmune globulin used in the past as prophylaxis after tick-bite may worsen the disease.
Wild birds. Over 100 bird species can be infected by WNV infection. Many birds get infected and amplify the virus but do not die. The robin is probably the main amplifying host, and rarely has overt disease. American crows, blue jays, and hawks are susceptible to death. The number WNV bird deaths can predict subsequent disease severity in humans and equines.
Serology (acute and convalescent sera) using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Isolation of leptospira from blood or CSF during first 10 days of illness and urine during the 2nd and 3rd weeks; PCR may provide early diagnosis. Dark-field microscopy is not recommended.
Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), Israeli spotted fever (ISF), Siberian or North Asian tick typhus (STT/ NATT), Queensland tick typhus (QTT), Japanese or Oriental spotted fever (JSF/OSF), Astrakhan fever (AF), African tick bite fever (ATBF), Flinders Island spotted fever (FISF), Indian tick typhus (ITT), Boutonneuse fever.
Personal anti-mosquito precautions; there is no vaccine for WEE.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Pig-to-pig, with occasional spill-over to humans.
Sudden onset fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, severe abdominal or lower back pain, often with nausea and vomiting, followed by hypotension which may progress to shock, hemorrhages and renal involvement, and death. Convalescence is prolonged. PUUV virus causes less severe disease. The CFR is 5–15% for HFRS; for PUUV and SAAV infection the CFR is 1%; for DOBV the CFR is 9–12%. The differential diagnosis is leptospirosis or rickettsioses.
Community management by SAFE strategy (see above). The WHO Alliance for the Global Elimination of Trachoma (GET 2020) seeks to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.
World wide there are approximately 1.5 million new cases of CL per year, with most cases reported from Afghanistan, Algeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria in the Old World. The highest burden of CL in the Old Word is in rural semi-arid and desert regions, but transmission is being increasingly seen in peri-urban and urban environments. Disease prevalence increases with age and then plateaus, likely due to acquired immunity. Clusters of leishmaniasis are seen in households, which is likely related to the short flight range of sandflies.
None.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Inhalation of contaminated aerosols generated from infected animal body fluids (placenta, urine, milk, feces) or dust contaminated with dried animal excretions. Less common routes are enterally when consuming contaminated food products and possibly through skin inoculation. Personto-person transmission is rare.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment
Serology (IFA on acute and convalescent serum); cross-reactivity occurs. Microscopy of blood or bone marrow smears is insensitive; PCR on acute phase whole blood; isolation by cell culture in reference labs.
Anthrax has a worldwide distribution. Livestock vaccination, antibiotic treatment, and quarantaine regulations lead to a strong decline in anthraxinfections in domestic lifestock. Anthrax occurs mainly in rural areas in countries where there is no livestock vaccination and no veterinary control of slaughtered animals.There is a seasonal variation in animal disease with an increase in cases during hot dry weather. Anthrax is an occupational hazard for people who process contaminated animal tissues. GI anthrax occurs when infected tissue is ingested. Of note is the terrorist distribution of anthrax powder by mail in the USA in 2001, which killed 5 people and produced sickness in 17.
The protein concentrates in tissues of the central nervous system. Prions are resistant to normal cooking temperatures and humans are thought to be infected by ingesting contaminated food. In contrast to other forms of human prion diseases, in vCJD significant levels of infectivity are found in the lymphoreticular system (lymph nodes, spleen, tonsil, and appendix).
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control, disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas.
By mosquito bite. Airborne transmission has been reported among laboratory personnel.
Wildlife–tick–wildlife. The tick ingests infected blood of reservoir host, virus passes from gut to hemocoele to salivary glands and is transmitted to a new host at the next feed. The virus is transmitted from tick to tick trans-stadially and transovarially. Trans-stadial transmission is key to tickborne infections.
Mosquito-host-mosquito. The mosquito becomes infected when feeding on a viremic reservoir host. Depending on ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is transmitted by feeding on the next host in several days.
Through inhalation of aerosolized microconidia from disturbed soil or guano. Also by inoculation and organ transplantation.
Consumption, white plague, TB.
PCR on blood or skin biopsy, or IFA on the latter. Serology is unspecific due to cross-reactivity.
By mosquito bite. There is no direct person-toperson transmission documented, and no evidence of congenital transmission.
Malaria requires urgent treatment and type of treatment depends on disease severity and drug resistance in the region. Artemisinin resistance has been confirmed in the Thai–Cambodian border region. Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria: artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs); the choice of ACTs is based on the resistance levels of the partner medicine in the combination. Artemisinin and its derivatives should not be used as monotherapy. Severe malaria: artesunate iv or im; complete treatment with an ACT or artesunate plus doxycycline or clindamycin.
Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. Generally, treatment is continued for at least 3 days after the patient is afebrile.
Human.
Enterotoxin-producing Vibrio cholerae 01 and 0139 Bengal. Serogroup 01 has two biotypes, classical and El Tor, each with three serotypes: Inaba, Ogawa, and the rarer Hikojima.
Praziquantel is recommended; alternative: oxamniquine for S. mansoni, metrifonate for S. haematobium.
Bat to bat via unknown route. Humans and domestic animals are incidental hosts.
Ingestion of raw or undercooked fish. There is no person-to-person transmission.
By tick bite; larval ticks are carried on migrating birds, which are refractory to the virus. The virus is also spread among veterinarians, farmers, shepherds, butchers, and slaughter-house workers by contact with the blood of infected livestock. Person-to-person spread is by contact with infectious body fluids of patients.
Humans.
The most prevalent HTLV-1 clinical manifestations can be divided into those associated with ATL (immunosuppression) or associated with HAM/TSP (immunoactivation). The HTLV-1-infected individual who immunologically tends to immunosuppression can develop opportunistic infections such as Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection, recurrent skin infections and ATL. The HTLV-1infected individual who tends to immunoactivation can develop HTLV-associated uveitis, polymyositis, inclusion body myositis, arthritis, pulmonary infiltrative pneumonitis, Sjogren syndrome and HAM/TSP.
HFRS is caused by Myodes-, Rattus-, and Apodemusborne hantaviruses. Each virus has its particular host: Apodemus spp. (striped field mouse) for HTNV, DOBV and SAAV and Myodes ( Clethrionomys) for PUUV. SEOV infects Rattus norvegicus and can therefore be found world wide.
None.
Microscopy for eggs in stool (S. mansoni) or urine (S. haematobium) samples; quantification of eggs in stool by Kato–Katz method and in urine by standardized filtration techniques; PCR.
Kala-azar (Hindi for black sickness), black disease, dum-dum fever.
Recovery of S. pneumoniae from sputum, blood, CSF or other normally sterile fluids by culture or PCR. S. pneumoniae antigen test in urine.
Loiasis occurs in areas where the Chrysops vectors breed in the tropical rainforest of Central Africa, where it is estimated that 12–13 million humans are infected. The prevalence of microfilaremia increases with age, and is more common in men as they are more exposed. Loiasis has gained attention because of the serious adverse events that can occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns for onchocerciasis control. It has been proposed that areas where the Loiasis prevalence is > 20%, are at increased risk for adverse events during mass ivermectin treatment.
By airborne droplets from or contact with nose and throat secretions of infected persons, very high from 4 days before to 4 days after rash appears, or with fomites contaminated with those secretions. Droplets remain infectious for several hours, longer under conditions of low humidity. Measles virus is highly contagious.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment. Aspirin should be avoided.
Granuloma inguinale, granuloma venereum.
Sudden onset of high fever, headache, chills, vomiting, myalgias, photophobia and dysthesias; 50–90% of apparent cases develop encephalitis. In the USA, one-third of encephalitis cases die and one-third of the survivors are moderately to severely disabled.
Food-borne and transplacental (mother to child). Ingestion of L. monocytogenes occurs commonly world wide. Development of the disease depends on the host immunity.
Colorado tick fever is only present in North America (USA and Canada). In the USA, besides the states with human cases shown on the map, the virus has been isolated from ticks within the range of D. andersoni. The typical habitat of the tick and its rodent hosts is a south-facing slope above 1,500 meters with Ponderosa pine and shrubs on dry, rocky surfaces. Infection is seasonal, coinciding with the period of greatest tick activity in early summer. Human cases can be detected from March to September in the Rocky Mountain region, USA. Most human cases are males, aged 20–29 years, probably reflecting the frequency of outdoor activity in the mountains.
The vector defecates during feeding, and the infected feces are rubbed into the bite wound or conjunctivae, mucousmembranes, or abraded skin; blood transfusion, organ transplant and shared needles. Congenital infection occurs in 2–8% of infected pregnancies. Oral transmission occurs by eating or drinking contaminated food or drink.
Rarely by tick bite.
The natural reservoir is unclear. The fungus can be isolated from nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). The disease has also been reported in dogs and other animals. Culturing the fungus from soil is difficult and regularly negative. As armadillos have close contact with soil, it is expected that soil is a reservoir. By using ninebanded armadillos as sentinel animals, it has been shown that the habitat of P. brasiliensis is likely humid vegetation close to water sources.
Prevention is focused on eliminating BSE in cattle, preventing infected bovinematerial entering the animal and human food chain, and reducing the risk of secondary transmission to humans in the healthcare setting. To this end many countries have banned bovine meat and bone meal from livestock feed, slaughtered infected herds, and taken other precautions to prevent infected cattle from entering the human food chain. Measures to reduce the risk of transmission of vCJD through blood products include low-risk sourcing and leucodepletion. Further precautionary methods to reduce the risk of transmission through contaminated surgical instruments.
For W. bancrofti: Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles spp., and Aedes spp. in the Pacific Islands; for B. malayi: Mansonia, Anopheles, and Aedes; for B. timori, An. barbirostris. Anopheles spp. transmit parasites less efficiently than Culex spp., and Culex spp. are more abundant in urban settings.
It is estimated that 37 million people are infected worldwide, 97% of them in Africa, and remaining in small foci in Central and South America and Yemen. Onchocerciasis was imported into Latin America by the slave trade. Onchocerciasis prevalence is related to the proximity to riverine breeding sites of black flies, with the highest disease burden in communities adjacent to rivers. Prevalence of infection rises with age until around 20 years, after which infection profiles vary between geographical region and sex. Higher rates of morbidity are reported in men. This variation canbe explainedby heterogeneity in age, gender, and occupational exposure to vectors.
None.
Human infections occur via two main transmission routes: (1) mosquito bite, and (2) direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals (e.g. slaughtering, butchering, veterinary procedures, animal births, disposing of carcasses or fetuses) by percutaneous inoculation or inhaling aerosols. Transmissionmay be possible via consumption of raw milk of an infected animal. Person-toperson transmission has not been described. However, humans develop high viral loads in the blood, and may transmit virus to contacts.
The first hantavirus found in the New World was Sin Nombre virus in the ‘Four Corners’ area (USA) in 1993, where an outbreak occurred of severe pulmonary disease in previously healthy adults. Since then, sporadic outbreaks have been detected throughout the Americas, with new strains and reservoir hosts. Approximately 200 cases of HPS per year are reported in the Americas. There is no HPS in the Caribbean, probably because the rodent host Sigmodontinae is infrequent there. The number of cases is much smaller than that of HFRS in the Old World, but the CFR is higher. Cases confirmed by serology have been reported in Colombia and Venezuela but the identity of the hantavirus unknown. Seoul virus (see Hantavirus Disease, OldWorld map) seropositives in humans and Rattus norvegicus are found in many port cities in the Americas, spread by shipping, but without evidence of disease. Risk of exposure to hantavirus is correlated with outdoor occupations such as agriculture, in which a person might encounter rodents or their excreta; the greatest risk is entering rodent-infested closed buildings. Epidemiology differs by country and virus. In household contacts of index patients with HPS in Chile, the risk of secondary cases was 17.6% among sex partners and 1.2% among other household members. Infection is more common in males, with most cases occurring within the 20–40 age group.
Nantucket fever, Piroplasmosis.
Spherical, enveloped, negative sense RNA viruses forming a subgroup of the Bunyaviridae family. In the Americas, human pathogens belonging to the group are Guaroa virus (GROV), Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), LaCrosse virus (LACV), and snowshoe hare virus (SSHV). Those reported to cause human disease in Europe or Asia are Inkoo virus (INKV), Tahyna virus (TAHV), and SSHV.
Tick-small mammals and birds-tick; large mammals are necessary to maintain tick populations. Humans and lizards are dead-end hosts.
In Africa, isolated from Aedes africanus, Ae. apicoargenteus, Ae. luteocephalus, Ae. aegypti, Ae. vittatus, and Ae. furcifer mosquitoes; probably Ae. hensilii on Yap island.
Access to clean water and sanitation; protective clothing for occupational risk; after accidental exposure, dry the skin and apply 70% alcohol; mollusciciding; avoid contact with contaminated water bodies.
By sexual contact. In children with no history of abuse, the route of transmission is unclear. Several reported pediatric cases have been in contact with infected adults, but without evidence of sexual contact.
Giant intestinal fluke infection.
Personal anti-tick precautions. An inactivated mouse-brain vaccine is in use in Russia and eastern Europe. Healthcare workers caring for CCHF patients are at risk and need to take proper barrier precautions.
Culture (cysteine-enriched media) or PCR on specimens of affected tissues. Blood cultures are often negative. Testing should be done in a BSL-3 facility. Serology on acute and convalescent sera.
Common unspecific symptoms are acute febrile illness with chills, sweats, nausea, headache, and vomiting; high fever with chills is more common in P. vivax than in P. falciparum malaria. Recent reports provide evidence that vivax malaria is not as benign as previously thought. P. vivax can lead to severe anemia, acute respiratory distress, liver failure, renal failure, and even cerebral malaria.
For interrupting transmission: mass treatment with a single dose of albendazole or ivermectin combined with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) once a year for at least 5 years; or the regular intake of DEC-fortified salt for at least one year; individual treatment: DEC can worsen onchocercal eye disease and cause serious adversere actions in patients with loiasis. Pathogenicity of filarial nematodes is largely due to the immune response to their endosymbiotic Wolbachiabacteria, therefore doxycycline may be used. The treatment for hydrocele is surgery.
Hendra virus disease, Nipah virus disease.
The disease mainly affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes, shown by patches of pigmented or reddish skin with loss of sensation, peripheral nerve enlargement with loss of sensation, sometimes paralysis, muscle wasting and trophic ulcers. Patients are classified as having either PL or ML. PL is milder and characterized by < 5 skin patches or lesions. ML is defined as 5 skin patches or lesions. Skin lesions are often symmetric. Involvement of the nasal mucosa results in nasal congestion and epistaxis. Reduced sensation of digits may lead to their loss due to trauma. Up to 10% of cases with early lesions may resolve spontaneously.
Pus contains visible granules, histopathology of biopsy, culture (slow).
Microscopy of stained thick blood smears taken around noon; membrane filtration; PCR. Eosinophilia and high IgE levels are indicators of active infection.
Sudden onset fever, frontal headache, backache, diarrhea and a rash; usually resolves without sequelae; fatalities are rare and the result of hemorrhage or meningoencephalitis. ILEV and NRIV can cause hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. CVV rarely causes encephalitis, with only one fatal case reported in the USA in 1995.
The mosquito becomes infected with MAYV during feeding on a viremic host. The virus crosses the gut wall and multiplies in the organs of the mosquito. After a few days, depending on the ambient temperature, the virus reaches the salivary glands and is injected into the next host during feeding.
Typically a cardiopulmonary infection as opposed to the primarily renal infection produced by Old World hantaviruses; renal involvement and hemorrhage are rare in NewWorld cases. Symptoms are fever, myalgia, and GI pain, followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress and hypotension, with rapid progression to respiratory failure and shock. Convalescence is prolonged. CFR is 35–60%.
Human–mosquito–human around housing; monkey–mosquito–monkey and monkey–mosquito–human in the forests of West Africa and Malaysia. Human viremia lasts 3–5 days since onset of symptoms; the mosquito can transmit 8–12 days after taking a viremic blood meal, depending on the ambient temperature.
WHO (2010) estimates that there are over 120 million infections world wide, with 40 million patients incapacitated or disfigured by the disease, principally in India and Sub Saharan Africa. 90% of the infections are due to W. bancrofti. Chronic manifestations mainly occur in the elderly. About 27 million have hydrocele (men) and 16 million have lymphedema or elephantiasis of theleg (mostly women). Asia and South America have lower Bancroftian filariasis prevalences (below 8%) than Sub Saharan Africa (up to 37%) and Pacific Island (up to 48%) regions. Within areas of low prevalence, pockets of high prevalence may exist (e.g. Reciffe, Brazil). In the Americas there is only active transmission in four countries and mainly affects the poor and slum inhabitants. China has been declared non-endemic for lymphatic filariasis since 2007 and Korea in 2008, achieved by extensive control efforts. The vectors are still present and therefore there remains a risk of re-emergence.
By mosquito bite (Anopheles spp.); transmission has been described in needle sharing IVDUs and blood transfusion.
Adult worm can be extracted by carefully and slowly winding the worm around a stick over a period of days. Metronidazole or thiabendazole can facilitate the extraction process, but should be used with caution.
Pentavalent antimonials; pentamidine; amphotericin. Other drugs and regimens are being tested (including paramomycin, miltefosine).
Combination of atovaquone and azithromycin for mild-to-moderate illness, clindamycin and quinine for severe disease. Exchange transfusion for life-threatening infection, dialysis in case of renal failure. Chloroquine is ineffective.
Blood culture with prolonged incubation (42 days); lysis centrifugation blood culture systems or subculture of blood culture bottles onto fresh chocolate agar enhances sensitivity. Several serological assays are available (CFT, ELISA, IFA), but cross-reactivity occurs; PCR on blood and tissue.
By mosquito bite.
Serology or RT-PCR on blood or CSF; virus isolation.
None.
Infections are most frequent in a period of drought and winds (dust storms) after heavy rains that advance mold growth, usually late summer or early fall. It is estimated that more than 150,000 primary infections occur annually in the USA. Incidence in California and Arizona appears to have increased since 1991 and again since 2001, probably driven by immigration of non-immunes andwheather conditions that favor dissemination of the fungus. Prevalence of infection in northern Mexico is reported to be 10–40%. Male gender, African-American and Filipino race/ethnicity, immunosuppression, diabetes, older age and pregnancy are risk factors for chronic and disseminated disease. Infections outside the western hemisphere are extremely rare and primarily imported.
Treat patients to reduce the T. b. gambiense reservoir, and cattle to reduce the T. b. rhodesiense reservoir; screen blood donations; vector control: fly traps, insecticide-treated screens, ground and aerial spraying, release of sterile male tsetse flies.
Deer and dogs (E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii). The whitetailed deer is a complete host for maintaining the transmission cycle of E. chaffeensis. Deer, ruminants, and field rodents (A. phagocytophilum); unknown for N. sennetsu; other members of the genus parasitize the trematode worms of aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates.
By bite of an infected phlebotomine sandfly.
The California group viruses are widely distributed over all types of terrain. Each has its preferred vector mosquito species and host, for instance snowshoe hare for SSHV. LACV is the primary cause of arboviral encephalitis in children in the USA. Most LACV infections occur in those residing close to woodland breeding sites of Ae. triseriatusfrom July to September. Boys are more often affected with LACV, as they more often play in the woods. JCV is most commonly found around the Great Lakes in USA and Canada. The JCV vectors prefer hilly woodlands where they breed in ponds from April to June. SSHV, has a different ecosystem: (sub) arctic forests and tundras in Canada and Siberia. SSHV has been detected in China. SSHV transmission occurs during the arctic summer from May to August, and mainly affects children (<10 years), especially boys. Lumbo virus is a strain of TAHV isolated from mosquitoes in Mozambique (Africa), but no human cases have been diagnosed there.
Intestinal capillariasis, Pudoc mystery disease, wasting disease.
Unknown. It has been proposed that bamboo rats may amplify infectious dispersal stages for human infections.
Through breaks in skin, ingestion or aspiration of contaminated water, inhalation of contaminated dust. There are rare reports of transmission from human or animal cases to humans. Laboratory workers have been infected by aerosols.
Epidemic or louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF), endemic or tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF).
Rickettsia rickettsii, R. parkeri and R. africae, Gramnegative intracellular bacilli. R. rickettsii is the agent of RMSF, R. parkeri causes a RMSF-like illness. R. africae causes African tick bite fever and is rarely found in the new world. New agents are still being discovered regularly.
By inhalation of aerosolized excreta of the rodent host, or contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent excreta. Nosocomial transmission is regular in resource-constrained settings.
Tabanid adult female flies, mainly Chrysops silacea, C. dimidiata, and C. distinctipennis. These day-biting and bloodsucking flies breed in forested and damp environments (e.g. swamps or rotten vegetation). Other favorable environments are cocoa plantations. Chrysops are attracted by movement, dark objects, and smoke. The vector does not enter structures like homes or barns. Up to 18% of the vector population can be infected with L. loa in endemic areas.
Zika virus is present in the tropical regions in the Old World and is absent from the Americas (a single case in the USA was imported from Yap island). The competence of mosquitoes on the American continent for Zika virus is unknown. The geographic distribution is confirmed by virus isolation from cases, mosquitoes and sentinel monkeys. Positive results in serosurveys are not conclusive, because of extensive cross-reactions among flaviviruses. In 2007 a virgin soil epidemic affected 73% of the population of Yap island. There were no hospitalizations or deaths during this outbreak. Due to intense air travel in the Pacific region and presence of competent vectors, there is concern that the disease will spread to other islands and even beyond. Adult females have higher attack rates and few cases are found above the age of 60 years. Approximately 18% of individuals infected by the Zika virus develop symptoms; this is similar to that reported for West Nile virus infection.
Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness world wide and is generally a disease of poor rural communities. These communities are often in hot and dry regions. It is estimated that there are about 41 million people with active trachoma and 8 million with trichiasis. Highest prevalences are found in Sub-Saharan Africa. There is a high burden in Ethiopia and Sudan, where active trachoma in some communities can be found in > 50% of 1–9-year-old children and trichiasis in > 19% of adults. In Asia and Central and South America, the distribution ismore focal. Overall the incidence of trachoma is declining and the disease has disappeared from Europe and North America due to improved living conditions.
Viremic reservoir host to mosquito during feeding, then after an extrinsic cycle of a few days, the virus is transmitted to a new reservoir host during feeding.
Blood or bone marrow culture and other infected bodily tissues (urine, CSF); serology; PCR.
Infective larvae migrate out of the mouth part of the fly during bite onto the skin and subsequently enter the wound. The tabanid bite is painful with blood loss.
Pasteurize milk; do not eat unpasteurized dairy products, especially in endemic areas; brucellosis control in domestic animals; hygienic measures in farms and slaughter houses; screening of livestock. Laboratory infections occur where biosafety measures are not adequate.
The blood-feeding nematodes Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). A. ceylanicum has a limited distribution. The adult nematodes are up to 10mm long.
Sudden onset of high fever (biphasic), chills, myalgia, arthralgia, severe headache, ocular pain, conjunctivitis, anorexia, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. Spleen and liver can be palpable, and pericarditis or myocarditis may be found. A few cases have a petechial or maculopapular rash. Prolonged convalescence may follow. Children may have a more severe syndrome with hemorrhagic manifestations, including a more pronounced rash, DIC, and GI bleeding; or CNS involvement including meningitis and encephalitis. Fatalities are rare.

Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), an enveloped, spherical, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. WEEV is believed to have descended from an ancestral recombinant derived from eastern equine encephalitis virus and Sindbis virus.
WHO recommends vaccination of all newborns. In countries where prevalence is low: WHO recommends vaccination of all newborns.
The true worldwide distribution and incidence is unknown. Antibody prevalence in humans and livestock in countries with sporadic cases suggest that most human infections are subclinical or benign, or misdiagnosed and underreported. Cases are mainly sporadic and have been reported in humid areas of the tropics and subtropics world wide, mainly during the rainy season. Cases have been reported in dryer areas, like northeastern Brazil and north Iran. This is likely explained by the fact that these two areas have irrigated rice fields. In Southeast Asia, it is a disease of mainly rice farmers and others who are occupationally exposed to contaminated soil or water. In northeast Thailand, 20% of communityacquired septicemic cases are due to melioidosis, which accounts for 39% of fatal septicemias and 36% of fatal community-acquired pneumonias. Up to 80% of cases occur in those who are predisposed by underlying immunocompromising conditions such as diabetes, chronic renal disease, or alcoholism, age, chronic infection, or immunosuppressive therapy. Sporadic human infections with glanders (B. mallei), occur in equine veterinarians and pathologists, horse butchers, and laboratory workers.
Mumps virus, an enveloped RNA virus of the family Paromyxoviridae. Twelve genotypes are currently recognized.
Loiasis is not as severe as other filarial diseases. Typical finding is transient subcutaneous swellings (Calabar swellings) which are angiedemas. These swellings are itchy and mainly occur on the limbs, especially forearms and when close to joints may restrict movement. Less frequently: giant urticaria, arthritis, and fever. The adult worm sometimes migrates across the subconjunctiva of the eye. Encephalopathic reactions may occur during mass ivermectin treatment campaigns to control onchocerciasis. These SAEs mainly occur in those with heavy infection ( > 30,000 microfilariae per ml blood).
For bacteria, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, long-acting sulfonamides; for fungi, itraconazole, ketaconazole, or voriconazole. Resection of small lesions; advanced lesions may require amputation of the hand or leg.
Ehrlichiosis occurs worldwide, principally following the distribution of the transmitting tick vectors and reservoir species. Less is known of the epidemiology and ecology of E. chaffeensis as compared to A. phagocytophilum. Most HME cases are reported in the south-central and eastern USA, where A. americanum reaches high population densities. Approximately 70% of HME cases occur from May to July in the USA, corresponding to the peak feeding activity period of the ticks. HME is most commonly diagnosed in adults, with a male-to-female ratio of > 2:1. Most HME cases are single and not clustered. Recreational or occupational activities in rural tick-infested habitats are at risk. Majority of the cases have a history of a tick bite. Ehrlichiosis is often not recognized in Africa, where the primary diagnostic focus is malaria and typhoid fever. Sennetsu fever occurs in Asian regions where the eating of raw fish is common, such as in Japan. N. sennetsu has been detected in the climbing perch in Laos, a fish common throughout the Mekong River, Basin. Climbing perch is widely distributed and eaten in Asia.
Contamination of wounds with soil, dust or animal feces that contain C. tetani spores. Puncture wounds are most commonly associated with tetanus but it can result from even minor abrasions. Through injection of contaminated street drugs. Neonatal tetanus results from infection of the umbilical cord, either through the use of unclean instruments to cut the cord or through dressing the stump with contaminated materials.
TBE, Western, European or Central European tick-borne encephalitis, Siberian tick-borne encephalitis, Far Eastern tick-borne encephalitis (formerly known as Russian Spring Summer encephalitis), diphasic milk fever, diphasic meningoencephalitis

Coccidioides immitis (Californian) and C. posadasii (nonCalifornian), dimorphic, soil-borne, ascomycete fungi unique to the western hemisphere.
P. ovale initally was thought to be limited to Sub-Saharan Africa, Papua New Guinea, eastern Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is actually more widely distributed, and is reported in the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent, and various parts of Southeast Asia. P. ovale has not yet been reported in South America. In general, P. ovale is relatively uncommon, though in West Africa prevalences above 10% are observed. Also, infections are most common in children <10 years. There is likely underreporting due to underdiagnosis. Due to the short duration of parasitemia and low parasite loads, P. ovale is regularly ‘missed’ in cross-sectional surveys.
Long-tailed and pigtailed macaques, and banded leaf monkeys. P. knowlesi can also infect other primates, including New World marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), African olive baboons (Papio anubis), Old World macaques, and humans by blood passage and mosquito bites.
The nematodes: Anisakis simplex, A. physeteris, Pseudoterranova decipiens, and Contracaecum spp. A. simplex and P. decipiens are the most important species for human disease. Anisakis larvae are whitish, tightly coiled, 1.5–2 cm in length, and difficult to see in fish flesh. Pseudoterranova larvae are 2–3 cm in length and red to brown in color.
Francisella tularensis tularensis (Type A), F. tularensis holarctica (Type B), F. tularensis mediasiatica, Gram-negative non-motile intracellular coccobacilli that infect macrophages. Type A is highly virulent and divided into two clades: Francisella tularensis tularensis (Type A), F. tularensis holarctica (Type B), F. tularensis mediasiatica, Gram-negative non-motile intracellular coccobacilli that infect macrophages.
HME, HGA: fever, headache, anorexia, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting; occasionally a rash. Leucopenia and thrombopenia are common and thrombopenia may be life-threatening. HME cases may progress to meningoencephalitis. Sennetsu fever: sudden onset fever, chills, malaise, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat; generalized lymphadenopathy. Reinfection can occur. CFR is 2.7% for HME, <1% for HGA, and absent for E. ewingii infection.
Histoplasmosis may be divided into the following four types: (1) pulmonary histoplasmosis, (2) disseminated histoplasmosis, (3) cutaneous histoplasmosis, and (4) African histoplasmosis. Most infections are asymptomatic or mild and resolve without treatment. The acute phase begins with fever, malaise, chest pains and a dry cough. Chest X-ray findings are normal in 40–70% of cases. Severe infections result in mediastinitis, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and adrenal enlargement. Osteomyelitis is rare. Disseminated disease occurs in patients with altered cellular immunity such as individuals with AIDS and those receiving immunosuppressive medications. It presents with systemic complaints and multiple organ involvement: lung, spleen, bone marrow, adrenals, CNS and GI tract being the most affected. Disseminated histoplasmosis is fatal unless treated. Past infection results in partial protection. Reactivation is uncommon but may occur.
Japanese B encephalitis.
Detection of trypanosomes in blood, lymph, or CSF after concentration; IgM ELISA, IFA, PCR. A card agglutination trypanosomiasis test (CATT) is available for T. b. gambiense but not T. b. rhodesiense.
Drain abscesses, iv ceftazidime, meropenem or imipenem followed by eradication treatment using cotrimoxazole, with or without doxycycline. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is an alternative for those with resistant strains or where co-trimoxazole is contraindicated. Also usually sensitive to piperacillin or ticarcillin with clavulanic acid. There is an up to 10% relapse rate.
Immunization with diphtheria toxoid, usually formulated in a multivalent vaccine (see DTP3 map). Recommended schedule is a primary course of three doses in the first 4 months of life and one or two boosters between 18 months and 5 years. Treatment of cases and carriers with antibiotics to eradicate the organism and prevent further transmission.
Infection may be asymptomatic or progressive and fatal, if untreated. Onset is often insidious. Common symptoms include fever, malaise, weight loss, and sweats. Cough may be prominent. Symptoms can come and go. Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy are common findings. HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk for symptomatic infection. Bacterial co-infections, including tuberculosis, may occur. Anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia are common laboratory findings.
By tick bite, blood transfusion; bone marrow for transplantation is routinely screened in endemic areas.
Characterized by high fever of 2–7 days alternating with afebrile periods of 4–14 days, relapsing up to 13 times. Initial symptoms include generalized body aches, myalgias, arthralgias, headache, chills, sweats, and a transitory rash. Later symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dry cough, photophobia, neck pain, conjunctivitis, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, confusion; rarely hematuria and epistaxis. Long-term sequelae of TBRF include cardiac, neurological, and renal abnormalities, ophthalmia and abortion. LBRF is generally more severe than TBRF, but associated with fewer relapses.
Demonstration of Strongyloides larvae on repeated stool specimens by microscopy after concentration (coproculture or Baermann). Stool examination has poor sensitivity, particularly in chronic cases. Serological tests vary in sensitivity and specificity, and perform better in chronic cases and are therefore used for screening patients at risk for hyperinfection. PCR has higher sensitivity than microscopy. Hyperinfection: larvae or parasite DNA can be found in sputum and other specimens.
Human buccal flora.
Healthy humans can carry S. pneumoniae in their upper respiratory tract.
Probably non-human primates; the virus has been isolated from monkeys in Panama and French Guiana, also in the USA from a north-bound migratory bird. Antibody has been found in domestic animals and other vertebrates.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), an enveloped, single-stranded, positive sense RNA flavivirus. It is divided into five antigenic groups and four genotypes, whichmay belinked to differences in virulence.
World wide, but close to elimination in the Americas and targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015. In the absence of vaccination the prevalence of rubella infection by the age of 13 years ranges from 20 to 95%, but is most often over 50%. Reported data on clinical rubella are a vast underestimate since it is a mild disease with a clinical picture similar to several other infections. CRS is also grossly underreported. For example, it is estimated that over 45,000 CRS cases occur annually in Southeast Asia yet only an average of 13 CRS cases per year were reported to WHO between 2000 and 2009. Rubella is a public health concern because of CRS and in 1996 it was estimated that 110,000 CRS cases occurred annually in developing countries. Paradoxically, a poor rubella immunization program may actually increase the incidence of CRS if the burden of illness is shifted to young adults, where pregnancy is common. Therefore rubella immunization programs must achieve and maintain high immunization rates ( > 80%) or be supplemented by the immunization of women of childbearing age. In 2009 two-thirds of countries included a rubella containing vaccine in their national immunization schedule yet in many developing countries rubella vaccine has not been included because of lack of information on the burden of CRS, costs, and concerns about causing a paradoxical increase in CRS cases.
Domestic and peridomestic rodent control; disinfection of rodent-contaminated areas; formalin-inactivated HTNV vaccines are used in Russia, China and Korea.
Blastomyces dermatitidis (teleomorph Ajellomyces dermatitidis), a dimorphic fungus: grows as a pathogenic yeast at body temperature and as a mold in the environment.
Vector control; mosquito repellent; insecticidetreated bed nets; treatment of infected humans.
Forest rodents, marsupials, and bats.
Mainly humans. In Southeast Asia, monkeys, wild carnivores, dogs, and cats may also be infected with B. malayi. W. bancrofti has no known reservoir host.
Studies of unvaccinated populations in some western countries indicate that almost everyone will be infected with mumps by adulthood; however the epidemiology of mumps is less well characterized in developing countries. The true number of mumps cases is not known, since it is often a mild disease and reported cases probably represent fewer than 10% of all infections. There is geographic variation in circulating mumps virus genotypes, and there can be several genotypes circulating simultaneously in one area and shifts over time in predominant genotypes. Mumps vaccination is recommended at age 12–18 months and is included in the standardimmunization program ofmost developed countries, usually in a trivalent vaccine with measles and rubella (MMR vaccine). A booster dose in later childhood is also recommended for countries with a good immunization program. Several developed countries with a well-established mumps vaccination program have experienced significant outbreaks in young adults, who were too old to be included in the childhood immunization schedule and had not been exposed to natural infection due to an overall reduction in the transmission of mumps in the population. Other possible reasons for mumps outbreaks in vaccinated populations include a waning of vaccine-induced immunity and genotype mismatch between the vaccine strain and the wild virus. Since the complications of mumps are more common in affected adults compared to affected children, a shift in the average age of infection can lead to an increase in the number of observed complications. However, despite these issues, it must be remembered that comprehensive mumps vaccination programs are associated with a massive overall decrease in the burden of mumps morbidity.
The disease is self-limiting and acute symptoms are similar to acute hepatitis A disease. Children are generally asymptomatic or have mild disease. Clinical evident disease is more common in age group 15–44 years, with following symptoms: fatigue, fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, and light stool. Pregnant women are at risk for severe disease, including fulminant hepatitis and death. In immunocompromised persons (e.g. transplant recipients or users of immune-modulating therapy) chronic infection has been reported.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), Korean Hemorrhagic Fever, Hemorrhagic Nephrosonephritis, Nephropathia epidemica
Gradual onset, malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, chest, and abdominal pain; inflammation and exudation of the pharynx and conjunctivae are common. Progression to multisystem disease occurs in 20% of infections, with hypotension or shock, hemorrhage, pleural effusion, seizures, encephalopathy and edema of the face and neck. Transient alopecia, ataxia, and eighth cranial nerve deafness may follow; deafness may be permanent. In third-trimester pregnant patients, 80% have a fatal outcome and 95% of the fetuses abort. The overall CFR is 1%, but 15–20% in more severe, hospitalized patients.
Rodent control in and around dwellings; infection control in hospitals, with barrier nursing and precautions to avoid contact with body fluids.
Bilharziasis, Katayama fever or syndrome, urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis.
It is estimated that over one million cases of scrub typhus occur each year. Infections most often occur in rural areas where diagnostic facilities are limited. Scrub typhus is thought to occur within the so-called ‘Scrub typhus triangle,’ bounded by Siberia (north), Kamchatka Peninsula (east), Pakistan (west), and Australia (south). O. tsutsugamushi infection primarily occurs in tropical climate in Asia, but is also found in temperate zones and semi-arid climates, including in scrub, gardens, forests, beach areas, and mountain deserts. In 2010 the western limit of the Orientia genus extended westwards to Dubai when a patient was diagnosed with a new Orientia species (O. chuto). In southern China, human infections typically occur in the summer and in northern areas the disease occurs mainly during autumn and winter. The migration of infested or infected rodents can lead to the establishment of new foci of disease.
RVFV primarily causes disease in animals in Africa and Middle East, with human cases occurring during animal epidemics. Humans that regularly work with animals (farmers, herders, veterinarians, slaughterhouse workers) are at increased risk of infection. Epidemics in animals occur when mosquito populations dramatically increase after periods of heavy rainfall or the production of wetlands behind man-made dams. RVF was initially confined to Sub-Saharan Africa, but appeared in Egypt in 1977 and was discovered on the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia and Yemen) in 2000 and later also on the Comoros Islands. As RVFV epidemics are closely associated with above-average rainfall, outbreaks can be forecasted upon which preventive measures can be implemented.
Proper cooking, or freezing of fish at 20 C for 7 days destroys the parasite. Abandon use of human feces to fertilize fish ponds.
Clinical diagnosis of active disease by presence of follicles and papillae on the conjunctival epithelium of the upper eyelid. Trichiasis and corneal opacity are also diagnosed clinically. Presence or absence of infecting agent (by any method, including PCR) has poor correlation with presence or absence of disease or its severity; serology has no diagnostic value.
Sanitation. Avoid eating uncooked water plants in endemic areas. Do not fertilize water plants for consumption with human or pig feces. Abandon practice of feeding water plants to pigs. Health education. The eggs can resist low temperatures and can be maintained at 4 C for 3 to 4 months; they are killed at 50 C in 4 hours. Water can be chemically treated to kill the flukes.
Freshwater (pond) snails (Lymnaeidae).
Plasmodium falciparum, an intracellular protozoan parasite in the Phylum Apicomplexa. Among the malaria parasites, P. falciparum causes the vast majority of mortality.
Lice become infective 4–5 days after an infectious blood meal and remain so for life (20–30 days). Infected ticks remain infective for life (in excess of 10 years).
Tsutsugamushi disease, miteborne typhus fever, chigger-borne rickettsioses, coastal fever (Australia).
Rat–mollusc–rat; humans are incidental dead-end hosts. Larvae are excreted with rat feces, ingested by vectormolluscs, in which they develop into the infecting third stage larvae in about 12 days. When ingested by a rat, the larvae enter the brain, mature into adults, and migrate through the bloodstream to the lungs. There, female worms lay eggs (about 15,000 per day) that hatch into larvae, which in 6–8 weeks migrate through the bronchial system up the trachea to the pharynx, are swallowed and excreted. When ingested by a human, the third stage larvae also migrate to the CNS, but the worm does not mature.
Anti-mosquito precautions; there is no vaccine available.
Principally humans; also warm-water marine and estuarine copepods, other zooplankton. Crabs, shrimps, and shellfish carry the vibrio on their carapaces and shells.
Main transmission is fecal–oral, but houseflies act as supplementary vectors by contaminating food after feeding on exposed human feces.
Clostridium tetani, a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium. The spores can remain viable in the environment for years. C. tetani produces a highly potent exotoxin, tetanospasmin, which is responsible for the clinical features of tetanus.
High altitude rodents, including ground squirrels and porcupines; ticks by trans-stadial transmission; possibly transovarial, but this is considered unlikely.
Inhalation of arthroconidia (reproductive spores) from the environment or dusty fomites. Sometimes through direct inoculation or transplantation. Person-to-person transmission is extremely rare.
Human.
Consumption of raw or undercooked uneviscerated fish that have ingested infected feces of humans or waterfowl. There is no person-to-person transmission.
None.
Microscopy (Kato-Katz method). Quantitative fecal egg counts are a marker for worm burden: 2,000 to 4,000 eggs per gram of feces is considered to be moderate infection, and 4,000 eggs is heavy infection.
Piscivorous (fish-eating) mammals, including: humans, dogs, cats, pigs, rats, and several species of wild animals. Humans can remain infected for several decades.
About 60% of exposures result in asymptomatic infection. Symptoms range from benign pulmonary infection (fever, chills, cough, chest pain, dyspnea), night sweats, anorexia and weight loss to progressive pulmonary or extrapulmonary disease involving skin, bones and/or joints, the central nervous system, and other organ systems. Most patients with primary disease recover spontaneously and have life-long immunity to re-infection. Chronic and disseminated disease is estimated to occur in up to 5% of cases. Meningeal infection occurs in less than 1% of extrapulmonary cases and requires life-long treatment.
TBRF is primarily transmitted by Ornithodoros ticks. LBRF is transmitted by the human body louse (Pediculus humanus); neither the head louse nor the pubic louse has been shown to transmit the disease.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an enveloped RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. CHIKV belongs to the same antigenic complex as Mayaro, Ross River, and o’nyong-nyong viruses. Phylogenetic analysis suggests an African origin about 500 years ago, with spread to Asia within the last century.
Fish-eating mammals (including humans) shed C. sinensis eggs into the environment that are ingested by snails, where they develop into cercariae. The motile cercariae are released into water and infect freshwater fish and encyst in meat and skin as metacercariae. When ingested by mammals, the metacercariae migrate into the bile ducts where they develop into adult flukes that produce and excrete eggs into feces. The cycle takes approximately 3 months.
Supportive, there is no specific polio treatment.
Minute hard ticks: Ixodes ricinus in Eurasia, possibly Hemaphysalis longicornisin Korea, I. ovatusin Japan. I. scapularis (formerly I. dammini) in eastern North America, possibly I. dentatus in the central USA, I. pacificus in California and Washington state, USA.
Phlebotomine sandfly: Lutzomyia spp. (New World) and Phlebotomus spp. (Old World).
Painless cutaneous lesions appear at the site of sandfly bite and typically these develop into ulcers with a raised border. Occasionally nodular and rarely verrucous lesions. Multiple lesions and regional lymphadenopathy may be present. Lesions may resolve spontaneously or remain for several months to years. Rarely dissemination to mucosa occurs of the upper respiratory tract with local tissue destruction leading to disfigurement (most often by L. braziliensis, known as espundia), with risk of severe and sometimes fatal secondary infections.
Principally birds, secondarily rabbits, poultry.
Before 2004, CHIKV was considered a minor arboviral disease, but since then has spread globally, infecting millions of people. Most cases are symptomatic. CHIKV has been endemic in Africa for centuries, typically causing small epidemics in rural areas. CHIKV spread to Asia within the last 60 years producing urban outbreaks, similar to dengue fever, involving Ae. egypti. The global epidemic started since a mutation in the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein gene (A226V) occurred, that enhanced its infectivity and transmission by Ae. albopictus. The mutated CHIKV is succesful in spreading in tropical and temperate regions where Ae. albopictus is present. In 2005–2006 CHIKV spread from East Africa to virgin soil in the Indian Ocean Islands to produce epidemics affecting up to three-quarters of the population. Since 2006, CHIKV outbreaks with are reported from several (sub)tropical countries in the new world. CHIKV virus was imported into several European countries and caused a small outbreak with autochthonous transmission in northern Italy. CHIKV-viremic travelers can cause autochthonous transmission in previous CHIKV-free areas if Ae. albopictus or other competent mosquitoes are present.
Visual inspection for adult worm protruding from the skin lesion; microscopic identification of larvae released when lesion is immersed in water.
Supportive; intravenous ribavirin and convalescent human serum are recommended.
Noma is an opportunistic infection that evolves rapidly from a gingival inflammation to severe, mutilating orofacial gangrene, which is painless and usually unilateral. It begins as a small vesicle or ulcer on the gingiva that rapidly becomes necrotic and spreads to produce extensive destruction of the buccal and labial mucosa and tissues of the face, including the bone, which may result in severe disfigurement and even death. Noma can also cause tissue damage to the genitals (noma pudenda).
A large number of infective mosquito bites are necessary to establish infection.
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a dimorphic fungus. At room temperature, P. brasiliensis is a mold and at body temperature (37 C) a yeast.
Hepatitis B is a common disease world wide, despite the existence of a vaccine. The WHO estimates that globally 2 billion individuals have been infected, of which about 360 million have chronic disease. Yearly, it is estimated that there are 500,000 to 700,000 HBV associated deaths world wide. In high-endemic regions like Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Amazon basin, most individuals become infected during childhood (mother-to-child, or child-to-child). In developed regions, the prevalence is low and important routes of transmission are different, consisting mostly of unsafe sexual practices, IVDU, and occupational transmission in healthcare workers. Chronic HBV associated liver cirrhosis is more common in developed nations than in Southeast Asia, but the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma is lower compared to Southeast Asia. It is not yet fully clear whether this is due to differences in HBV genotype or age of infection.
Taeniosis: detection of eggs in stool by microscopy; T. solium eggs can not be distinguished from T. saginata eggs; serology; Neurocysticercosis: histology; CT or MRI scan brain; serology is not sensitive or specific for neurocysticercosis.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), an encapsulated Gram-positive bacterium, with > 90 serotypes based on capsular polysaccharide antigens. Approximately 23 serotypes are responsible for 90% if the infections in the developed world.
There is little known about the epidemiology of these viruses. Group C viruses are geograpically limited to the tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas, and were first described in the Brazilian Amazon in the 1950s. Studies show that these viruses circulate in a compact ecosystem in which co-infection with more than one virus is possible in reservoir hosts, leading to genetic reassortment. Genetic analysis shows evidence of intense traffic of these viruses in the Americas. Nepuyo virus has the widest distribution reported, from Mexico to Brazil. There is no sex or age preference for infection. Inapparent and mild infections are common, overt disease is mostly seen in children residing in endemic areas.
None
Detection of virus in respiratory specimens, stool or blood by RT-PCR; virus isolation; serology by IFA or ELISA. Specimen processing and testing should be performed under strict biosafety measures (BSL-3).
By mosquito bite.
Ingestion of tapeworm eggs from feces of foxes, dogs, and cats or contaminated fomites. There is no person-to-person transmission.
The principal clinical feature of tetanus is painful skeletal muscle spasms and rigidity. Three clinical forms are recognized. The commonest is generalized tetanus, which usually begins with spasms of the facial muscles and spreads in a descending pattern. On presentation patients commonly have ‘lockjaw’ (trismus), neck stiffness, difficulty swallowing, and abdominal rigidity. Generalized spasms may result in an arched posture (opisthotonus). Other symptoms include elevated temperature, blood pressure, and sweating. Localized tetanus presents as localized spasms of muscles around the entry wound. Cephalic tetanus is rare and results from infection in the head and neck, and affects cranial nerves.
Gradual onset of malaise, headache, and retro-orbital pain, conjunctivitis, fever, and sweats, followed by prostration. Petechiae on the soft palate are frequent, on the body with ecchymoses less frequent. In severe cases: epistaxis, hematemesis, melena, hematuria, and gingival hemorrhage. Enceplalopathy, intention tremors, depressed deep tendon reflexes, bradycardia, and hypotension with shock are common. Infection during pregnancy can result in abortion. Convalescence may be prolonged. CFR due to these viruses, even after intensive hospital treatment, can be as high as 33%.
None.
Benznidazole, pentamidine, melarsoprol, eflornithine, suramin, and nifurtimox are effective in acute cases; melarprosol and eflornithine can have SAEs. Patients need to be followed up for 1–2 years.
The louse-borne agent is responsible for epidemics, with a CFR of 30–70%; tick-borne agents cause endemic disease, with a CFR of 2–10%. LBRF has disappeared from Europe; tick-borne relapsing fever is found world wide, except in Australia and New Zealand, and is rare in Europe and North America. Human TBRF is frequent in endemic areas where people live in close proximity to burrows of reservoir animals. Otherwise, the disease is sporadic. LBRF is now found sporadically in epidemics in Africa, and is associated with refugee camps, natural disasters, and famine. LBRF used to be common world wide with large epidemics during the two world wars. It may re-establish anywhere in louse-infested human populations.
By mosquito bite. There is no direct person-toperson transmission.
None.
Large marsupials, particularly kangaroos and wallabies.
