10% of children and 30–50% of adults present with symptoms of acute HBV infection similar to hepatitis A and last several weeks: fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, jaundice, dark urine, and light stools. Fever is often absent and arthritis and rash may be present. Chronic disease evolves to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma and eventually death. 90% of infants who are infected in their first year develop chronic infection.

The number of cases diagnosed in the USA has increased markedly since 1975. Nearly all patients with Babesia divergens infection in Europe had been splenectomized and exposed to cattle. Infection is seasonal (summer), coinciding with abundance of nymphal ticks in warmer months.

Microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito. Larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed.  In humans, they travel via thelymphatics, when adults they form ‘nests’ and produce microfilariae

Eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies, mature in about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on water temperature, and hatch ciliated larvae (coracidia). Coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans (copepods). The copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host, typically small fish. The larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae.

The epidemiology of rotavirus serotypes has substantial temporal and geographic variability and multiple serotypes may cocirculate within the same region and fluctuates each year within the same region. The 5 most common rotavirus serotypes (G1–G4 and G9) were responsible for approximately 95% of infections world wide with G1[P8] responsible for more than 70% of infections in North America, Australia, and Europe but only 30% of infections in South America, Asia, and Africa.
