Hard ticks (Ixodidae). Depending on the tick species, they can acquire infection via feeding on animals with rickettsemia, or via venereal, transovarial, and transstadial passage. Animals preferred for feeding varies by tick species and their life stage. Hosts include dogs, rodents, and other animals.
Early diagnosis and treatment; safe sexual practices (condom use). Proper bodily hygiene.
Mumps is preventable by the use of live attenuated mumps virus vaccines. Various vaccine strains are available and may vary in immunogenicity and the incidence of adverse effects, such as fever, rash, parotitis, or meningitis.
Animal–mosquito–animal with spillover to humans in epidemics via direct/indirect contact to infected animal tissue or mosquito bite.
Dengue-like acute febrile illness with chills, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia and severe arthralgia of the small joints of the hands and feet, sometimes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, painful lymphadenopathies and often a maculopapular rash. Arthralgias may persist for months, but no fatalities have been recorded.
Supportive with pain management.
Infected individuals shed bacteria into environment, contaminating water and food products that are subsequently ingested by other humans.
Cattle with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy.
Microscopy to detect microfilariae in finger-prick blood smears; immunochromatic test cards; ultrasound to locate ‘nests.’
Undetermined. Thought to be forest rodents (squirrels, rats, mice, dormice), shrews and monkeys in the rainforests of West and Central Africa.
Ribavirin in combination with peg-interferon. Response to interferon differs by HCV genotype: there is a more sustained virological response in HCV genotype 2 and 3 infections, as compared to HCV genotype1 and 4. The peg-interferon and ribavarin response can be improved by the combination with oral DNA-polymerase and protease inhibitors.
By contact with the excretions, or materials contaminated with the excretions, of an infected rodent, such as ingestion of contaminated food or by direct contact of abraded or broken skin with rodent excrement. Infection can also occur by inhalation of minute particles soiled with rodent urine or saliva (aerosol transmission). Person-to-person transmission is rare and known only for Machupo virus.
Supportive and antibiotics: oral doxycycline, ampicillin or amoxicillin for mild disease, parenteral penicillin G, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime for severe disease.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, Four Corners disease.
Influenza A subtype H5N1, a RNA virus, family Orthomyxoviridae. Avian influenza H5N1 occurs in two forms, a virulent form known as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) and a milder form known as ‘low pathogenic’ (LPAI H5N1). H5N1 viruses have diverged into geographically distinct strains (genetic clades).
Inhalation of spores from disturbed soil. There is no person-to-person transmission.
Humans are the definitive host; pigs are an intermediate host.
Simian variola.
Historically, dracunculiasis was endemic in 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, with an incidence of 3.5 million cases per year (1986). An international control effort reduced that to just over 1,785 cases detected in five African countries by 2010: Mali, Ghana, South Sudan, Chad, and Ethiopia. Nearly 95% of the cases are reported from South Sudan. Additionally, Niger reported 3 imported cases from Mali. Chad did not report cases for more than 10 years when an outbreak occurred with 10 cases in 2010. In Mali and Southern Sudan, violence has interfered with the eradication campaign, but Ghana and Ethiopia are close to eradication. Ghana diagnosed their last indigenous case in May 2010. Dracunculiasis mainly affects poor communities without a safe portable water supply and is mainly limited to remote nomadic communities. There is a marked increase in infection in the dry season when stagnant pools are the only source of water. Most cases are young (working) adults who may be exposed to contaminated water sources more frequently. There is no particular age or sex predilection. Countries free of transmission neighboring endemic countries should remain alert for imported cases and take adequate preventive measures.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), North American tick typhus, New World spotted fever, Tick-borne or tick typhus, Tobia fever (Colombia), Sao Paulo fever or ‘febre maculosa’ (Brazil), and fiebre manchada (Mexico).
Human-deer-fly-human. After infectivelarvae enter the wound they migrate and develop into adult worms in subcutaneous tissue. Adult worms produce microfilariae, that circulate in the peripheral blood in daytime and can be taken up by the next fly during feeding. In the fly they develop into larvae in 10–12 days and enter the proboscis, and the cycle repeats. An infected human can remain infectious to the vector for up to 15 years. Transmission is facilitated by the fact that microfilaremia and the vector-biting activity occur in daytime.
The tick feeds on an infected host, the virusmultipliesin the tick’s midgut and spreads to the salivary glands, to be injected into another host at the next feed, where it infects erythrocytes. As the virus infects erythrocytes, it is partially protected from immune clearance, leading to prolonged viremia in both humans (up to 4 months) and rodents, favoring spread.
Yersinia pestis, a Gram-negative bacillus. Y. pestis is considered a potential biological warfare agent.
Vaccination of risk groups; eradicating carriage; hygiene; sanitation; access to clean water; pasteurization of dairy products; quality control and hygiene procedures for the food industry; exclude typhoid carriers from food handling.
Larval mites. Nymphs and adults do not feed on vetebrate hosts. The vector has adapted to various ecologies, including mountainous and tropical regions.
Ivermectin; alternative: albendazole or thiabendazole.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), an enveloped, singlestranded tripartite RNA virus, belonging to the genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae. There are three lineages: Egyptian, West African, and East-Central African. Zinga virus, isolated in 1982 inMadagascar, was later found to be a strain of RVFV.
Praziquantel; surgery in case of biliary obstruction.
None.
Avoid contact with armadillos or their habitat.
Bartonella bacilliformis, a fastidious intracellular Gramnegative bacterium.

Rotavirus antigen detection by EIA and other serological techniques; RT-PCR.
Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA alphavirus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae, with four lineages: Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is an enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA alphavirus, genus
Contact with freshwater bodies containing cercariae that penetrate skin or mucous membranes; drinking contaminated water (uncommon).
A self-limiting disease that lasts for about 4 to 7 days. Patients usually experience dengue-like illness with fever, muscle pain, headache, and joint pain. The disease may progress in some cases to one or more of three distinct syndromes: ocular (eye) disease (0.5–2% of patients) with retinitis and possible blindness; meningoencephalitis (about 1%), patients usually recover; or acute hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever (about 1%) with a CFR of 50%. Some patients are misdiagnosed as meningitis.
Epidemic non-A non-B hepatitis, fecal–oral non-A non-B hepatitis, enterically transmitted nonA non-B hepatitis.
In 2000, WHO started the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis that aims to interrupt transmission and reduce morbidity. Endemic areas are mapped with subsequent mass treatment for the population at-risk (see Therapy) for 5 years. Care needs to be taken in loiasis endemic areas to prevent adverse events (see Loiasis map); vector control (e.g. bed nets, repellent).
Fever, cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. Flukes may invade the brain and rarely the spinal cord, causing meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, epilepsy, and paralysis. They may also cause acute and chronic inflammation of the pleura, pericardium, and mediastinum. Chest Xray findings are similar to tuberculosis. Complications include pleural effusion, pneumothorax, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary fibrosis.
Angiostrongylus cantonensis, a nematode lungworm of rats. Adult worms are 17 to 25 mm long. Angiostrongylus costaricensis is the causal agent of abdominal, or intestinal, angiostrongyliasis and is not shown on the map. Other pathogens, like Gnathostoma spinigerum, are able to cause eosinophilic meningitis, but are not shown on the map.
Intestinal capillariasis starts with mild abdominal pain, borborygmus, and diarrhea, that develops to profuse watery diarrhea. If untreated: chronic diarrhea, vomiting, malabsorption, leading to weight loss, muscle wasting, cachexia, and eventually death. Hepatic capillariasis (C. hepatica) is a (sub)acute hepatitis with eosinophilia, that may disseminate to other organs and can be fatal. Pulmonary capillariasis (C. aerophila) may present with fever, cough, asthma, and pneumonia and may also be fatal.
S. stercoralis has a free-living (asexual) and parasitic (sexual) lifecycle. Free-living filariform (L3) larvae in the soil penetrate the skin, enter the bloodstream, reach the lungs, travel up to the throat, and are swallowed. In the duododenal wall they mature into adult female worms, produce eggs that hatch immediately, thus only larvae (L1) are excreted. These non-infectious (L1) larvae develop further in the soil into either adult worms or infectious (L3) larvae. Some non-infectious L1 larvae may develop faster into infectious L3 larvae in the human intestine and penetrate the perianal skin or colon wall. This process of auto-infection may lead to hyperinfection in immunocompromised individuals.
This is unknown at present. M. ulcerans has been found in biofilms on vegetation in swamps and other permanent wetlands, aquatic insects, snails, and fish. In Australia, some land animals, particularly native possums, have been found to carry M. ulcerans in their gastrointestinal tracts.
For LBRF, Borrelia recurrentis, a Gram-negative spirochete. For TBRF, at least 15 Borrelia species, each specific to a particular species of tick vector. Since the 1980s, the number of new Borrelia species associated with relapsing fever has increased, in part due to improved diagnostics.
Hares, hedgehogs, wild mice, livestock, ostriches. Since hard ticks overwinter and can pass the virus transovarially, ticks also serve as reservoirs.
For C. philippinensis: fish-eating birds. Freshwater fish are intermediate hosts.
Vaccination with vaccines based on capsular polysaccharides. Both conjugated and non-jugated vaccines are available. Conjugated vaccines targeting either 7, 9, 10, or 13 capsule types are recommended for children under 5 years of age and risk groups. The 23-valent non-conjugated vaccine can only be used in individuals older than 2 years and at high risk of disease. National surveillance of pneumococcal disease and infecting serotypes is required to detect vaccine escapees, requiring vaccine modification. Individuals are not protected against pneumococcal capsule types not in the vaccine. Through the GAVI Alliance, low-income countries can access pneumococcal vaccines with a small contribution. Rwanda was the first GAVI-eligible country that introduced the vaccine in 2009.
It is an occupational risk for those working in the environment in endemic regions (e.g. farmers, soldiers). Dust control where feasible (e.g. paving roads). Arthroconidia are resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can survive for many years in dust. Screening of organ donors for coccidioidomycosis in endemic areas. As the fungus is easily aerosolized it is a laboratory hazard.
Chronic, painless skin nodule that progresses to a severe,deforming ulcer. One-third of early nodules heal spontaneously. Most nodules appear on limbs, but also face and breast; skin lesions may also appear as plaques or indurated edematous lesions; osteomyelitis. Typical characteristic is the presence of deeply undermined ulcers. Sequelae include contracture, deformity, and permanent disability.
During blood meal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.
Diphyllobothriosis, Dibothriocephaliasis, broad or fish tapeworm infection
Individuals with trichiasis require eyelid surgery. Active disease requires antibiotics: azithromycin or tetracycline eye ointment are recommended. Treatment of individual cases has little impact, because of rapid reinfection. Community management using the SAFE strategy (Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics to clear infection, Facial cleanliness and Environmental improvement [water and sanitation] to reduce transmission) is the recommended means for control in endemic areas; this strategy includes both treatment and prevention.
Hendra virus: pteropid bats are the primary reservoir of Hendra virus and are asymptomatic. The viruses can be isolated from their reproductive tracts and urine. The epidemiological reasons for the emergence of Hendra virus infection in horses are not clear. All human cases had close contact with infected horses. Nipah virus outbreaks have occurred only in South Asia and may be associated with the bat-breeding season. In Malaysia, it was hypothesized that the bats fed on fruit trees in pig farms, and that fallen fruit contaminated with bat saliva containing Nipah virus was eaten by pigs, who became infected. Nipah viruses have been isolated from bats in Cambodia and Thailand, and a high seroprevalence has been found in fruit bats in NW India, in the absence of reported pig or human disease. In Bangladesh, there is epidemiologic evidence of bat–human transmission without an intermediate livestock host, and of human–human transmission. Young boys who gather fruit from the trees are at higher risk of disease. Also drinking palm sap from trees is a potential risk factor. Antibodies to henipaviruses have been found in fruit bats in Madagascar (Pteropus and Eidolon sp.) and in Ghana (Eidolon sp.), but in the absence of virus isolation or RNA detection, it is not possible to know which virus is involved. No human or animal cases have been reported in Madagascar or in Africa.
None.
Direct: acid fast smear/culture and PCR of sputum and other body fluids, depending on clinical presentation; serological: tuberculin skin test (Mantoux); interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs). Culture in liquid media is gold standard and allows for antibiotic susceptibility testing but takes weeks to months; PCR allows for early detection, and recent assays include detection of resistance-associated mutations.
Tabanid and Stomoxys flies and mosquitoes can transmit, but are not epizootic vectors. Blow-flies can also spread the bacteria.
SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded, enveloped RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae. The viral membrane contains a transmembrane (M) glycoprotein, spike (S) glycoprotein, and envelope (E) protein. Coronaviruses derive their name from the crown-like (coronalike) morphology on electron microscopy.
Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) using reduced osmolarity ORS; intravenous rehydration in severe cases. Antibiotics are only useful to prevent spread, as they do not affect the already released toxin.
Occupational hygiene by the use of protective clothing and avoiding contaminated surface waters (difficult in case of flooding in developing countries). Environmental control measures, like rodent and flood control, are difficult to implement. Chemoprophylaxis for adventure travelers, military personnel who visit endemic areas, and after an accidental lab exposure.
Rarely reported in the Americas and Europe, sporadic in parts of Southeast Asia, especially Thailand, China, and Vietnam. Most important risk factor is contact with pigs or uncooked pig products, typically by farmers, veterinary personnel, abattoir workers, and butchers. Furthermore, in several Asian countries it is common to consume uncooked pork products, like blood, which is a risk for acquiring the disease. Individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those who have been splenectomized, are also at increased risk. Since S. suis is often misidentified, S. suis may be more common in certain parts of the world with high pig densities.
Especially prevalent in pig-rearing regions of Southeast Asia, where it is estimated that 10 million people are infected. The disease is most common in lowlands where the snail host is present and it is common practice to fertilize water plants with pig or human feces. Disease spread is facilitated by heavy rainfall and extensive flooding, leading to fecal contamination of the water. Highest incidence and intensity of infection is found in 10 to14 year old children (no sex difference), probably because they pick and consume water plants when they play. In foci of parasite transmission, the prevalence of infection in children ranges from 57% in mainland China to 25% in Taiwan, and from 50% in Bangladesh and 60% in India to 10% in Thailand. Water morning glory (Ipomoea aquatica), water caltrop (Trapa bicornis), lotus (Nymphaea lotus), water cress (Neptunia oleracea), and water hyacinth (Eichhornia speciosa) are most responsible for human infection, but cysts also float on the surface and may be drunk.
Lice infestation (pediculosis) can be controlled by treating clothes and bedding with insecticides or boiling (bedding at shelters is a major source of lice infestation). The body does not need to be deloused as the lice live and lay their eggs in clothes or bedding. Oral ivermectin has been effective in delousing homeless people.
From asymptomatic to fatal. Acute febrile illness with chills, headache, severe myalgia (with mild rhabdomyolysis), conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptoms. Less common findings are hepatomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, jaundice, and aseptic meningo-encephalitis. Pulmonary symptoms may occur varying from cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis, to adult respiratory distress syndrome. Weil disease is a severe form of leptospirosis and is characterized by jaundice, renal failure and hemorrhage with a CFR of 5–20%.
The principle vector is the human body louse (Pediculus humanus corporis), which lives in clothes. B. quintana has also been detected in cat and monkey fleas.
For S. stercoralis: mainly humans, although infections in non-human primates and dogs have been described. S. fuelleborni is mainly found in in monkeys, but human-to-human transmission may occur in some geographical regions.
A granulomatous fungal infection of the lung, skin, bone or genitourinary tract. Pulmonary infection may be acute or chronic. Acute: fever, cough and pulmonary infiltrate, resolving in 1–3 weeks. Chronic infection is more common and characterized by erythematous papules on the face and extremities, low-grade fever, and weight loss; pulmonary infection may cavitate. Occasionally bone, prostate, epididymis and central nervous system may be affected. Untreated disseminated or chronic pulmonary disease is generally fatal. The main differential diagnosis is tuberculosis.
Rickettsia aeschlimannii, R. africae (ATBF), R. australis (QTT), R. conorii caspia (AF), R. conorii conorii (MSF), R. conorii indica (ITT), R. conorii israelensis (ISF), R. helvetica, R. honei (FISF), R. japonica (JSF/OSF), R. massiliae, R. sibirica (STT/ NATT), Gram-negative intracellular bacilli. New agents are still being discovered regularly.
Consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater fish containing infectious larvae. There is no direct person-to-person transmission.
Mosquito to reservoir animal to mosquito. There is an enzootic cycle, mainly between C. taralsis and passerine birds. There is a secondary cycle that involves rabbits. Viremia lasts 2–5 days in birds. Extrinsic cycle in the mosquito lasts up to 7 days but transmission can occur in as little as 4 days. Humans and horses are dead-end hosts for WEEV because their viremia is generally not high enough to infect mosquitoes.
Depends on portal of entry. The skin lesion is a characteristic black eschar surrounded by edema, usually on the head, forearms or hands, accompanied by malaise and fever, in 80% of cases resolving spontaneously after 7–10 days, but if left untreated it may evolve into fatal septicemia. GI anthrax produces nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, hematemesis, occasionally bloody diarrhea and often fatal septicemia and shock. Inhalation anthrax is rapidly progressive and starts with fever, malaise and mild cough and chest pain, evolving to acute respiratory distress, diagnostic mediastinal widening, cyanosis and shock. Untreated cutaneous anthrax has a CFR of 5–20% (<1% with treatment), GI anthrax 25–60%, and inhalation anthrax 100% (75% with treatment).
Since the end of 2003 the A/H5N1 virus has spread globally, infecting poultry in over 60 countries and causing the loss of over 250 million poultry. In 2010 HPAI H5N1 remained entrenched in poultry in several Asian countries and Egypt. While migratory waterfowl plays a role in the long-distance spread of H5N1 (see Bird Migration map), the intensification of poultry farming and poorly regulated movement and trade in poultry is probably the most important factor in sustaining the current epizootic. HPAI H5N1 is highly contagious between birds and has a high fatality in most poultry species, making it an economically important disease. However, it is the risk to humans that has driven most of the control activities. Over 500 human cases have been detected in 15 countries. The concern remains that H5N1 may evolve or reassort with another influenza A virus to become either more transmissible from poultry to humans or transmissible from person to person.
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Approximately 15 to 20 million people worldwide are believed to be infected. In Africa all HTLV and STLV subtypes are found, and phylogenetic research suggest that HTLV-1 originated in Africa about 27,000 years ago. HTLV-1 infection is more common in women and the prevalence increases with age, with a peak incidence around age 50. Among HTLV-1 carriers, the lifetime risk of developing HAM/TSP ranges from between 0.3% and 4%. For ATL, this risk is estimated to be 1% to 5% and for HTLV-1-associated diseases in general, including ATL, HAM/TSP, uveitis, polymyositis and arthropathy, the lifetime risk may be close to 10%. Japan, Africa, Caribbean islands and South America are the areas of highest prevalence, but the reasons for this are unknown. Most infections world wide are due to subtype HTLV-1a. Distribution of the infection is focal, e.g. Brazil, Japan, and Iran, where HTLV-1 is limited to certain areas of each country. On several Japanese islands the prevalence can reach 37%. Socioeconomic or genetic factors may contribute to the development of HTLV-associated infective dermatitis, since the disease has not been reported in HTLV-1 epidemic Japan. For non-endemic areas such as Europe and North America, HTLV-1 infection is mainly found in immigrants from endemic areas, their offspring and sexual contacts, among sex workers and IVDUs.
Microscopy: in Giemsa-stained blood smears Schüfnner’s dots are seen; rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs); PCR.
The mites are infected by feeding on reservoir animals (small rodents), and maintain the infection throughout their life stages. The infection is passed on by transovarial transmission. O. tsutsugamushi are present in the salivary glands of the larvae and injected into the host during feeding.
Immunization with tetanus toxoid (inactivated tetanus toxin). Immunization of pregnant women protects infants from neonatal tetanus.
Prevent intimate contact with cases and contamination of environment from lesions. Lesions or discharge from the lesions are infectious. Treat close contacts. There has been a drastic decline in global disease prevalence since mass treatment campaigns with penicillin under the technical guidance ofWHO and with material support from UNICEF in the 1950s and 1960s.
Animal to animal, with occasional spill over to humans. Sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented.
The cestode Diphyllobothrium latum (fish or broad tapeworm), the largest human tapeworm (up to 25 meters long). In Japan and eastern Russia D. nihonkaiense is common. At least 13 other Diphyllobothrium species have been reported to infect humans, but less frequently.
Flies can contaminate foods.
Poliovirus, an RNA enterovirus with three types; type 1 cases are most common, followed by type 3; wild type 2 disappeared in 1999. Rare cases of all three types occur in unimmunized contacts of children vaccinated with the Sabin live attenuated vaccine.
Wild, migratory birds of the order Passeriformes (mainlyfieldfare, redwing, and songthrush) and Anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans). Tetraonid birds (grouse) population size changes coincide with SINV epidemics in Finland. Larger passerine species have higher prevalences of infection as compared to smaller species.
Fox–rodent–fox (sylvatic cycle). Foxes are the definitive hosts of the adult worm. Eggs are excreted with the feces and ingested by humans or the intermediate rodent host, where they hatch. The larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and via the blood they reach the liver, lungs, brain, and heart. There they form metacestodes in which protoscolices develop. When the rodent is eaten by the definitive host, these attach to the small intestine and grow into adult worms. Occasionally wild carnivores (e.g. coyotes or wolves) can be definitive hosts. In some rural areas there is a synanthropic cycle in which dogs or cats are definitive hosts, acquiring the parasite from wild rodents.
Primary: BCG vaccination of children protects against disseminated disease. Secondary: intensive search for and treatment of source cases; contact investigation and treatment of positive cases with chemoprophylaxis. WHO has established a ‘Stop TB Partnership’ program to control TB world wide.
Buruli ulcer is named after Buruli county in Uganda, where the disease was common in the 1960s. The disease is reported in 30 countries with tropical climates, but it may occur in some temperate regions. West Africa is the most affected region. Typical Buruli endemic regions are areas with slow-flowing or stagnant water. Flooding due to deforestation or the construction of dams, and irrigation systems such as rice fields, can lead to outbreaks. Outbreaks have also been associated with mining activities in Africa, due to creation of pits with stagnant water. In southern Australia several coastal towns have reported local outbreaks. It is unclear what triggered these outbreaks. World wide, mainly children are susceptible to Buruli ulcer disease.
Trematode worms Schistosoma japonicum, S. malayensis, and S. mekongi.
Unknown.
Leptospirosis has a worldwide distribution, is more common in tropical regions where it is both an occupational disease and a disease of ‘daily lives,’ mainly during heavy rainfall. Most foci are found in Latin America and the Caribbean, India, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and eastern Europe. The agent favors warm, humid environments. The prevalence of different serovars depends on the reservoir in which animals are present, local environmental conditions, local occupation, and agricultural practices. Protective measures have decreased the occupational risk in high-risk jobs, like mining, sewermaintenance, farming, veterinary work, and the military. In the tropics, occupational exposures (rice and sugar cane farming, fishing) and other agricultural activities remain an important risk. Leptospirosis is an emerging disease in slums, especially during rainy seasons. Also large recreational events with water exposure can be an important source of big multinational outbreaks.
Hendra virus: encephalitis and pneumonia, with a rapid progression to death (few survive). One case recovered from encephalitis but relapsed 14 months later and died with neurologic signs, suggesting latency and recrudescence. Nipah virus: encephalitis and pneumonia. There has been a case of relapse encephalitis more than 4 years after infection. The CFR can vary from 10 to 75%, but is generally high.
Dengue-like acute febrile illness with sudden onset fever, severe chills, severe headache, eye pain, symmetrical polyarthralgia of all joints (as opposed to dengue, which attacks mainly elbows and knees), generalized myalgia, sometimes dry cough and coryza, leucopenia and often an itching, descending morbilliform rash. Marked cervical lymphadenitis distinguishes it from chikungunya infection. Hemorrhagic signs have not been seen. Recovery is complete, without sequelae.
No specific treatment is available.
Soil, animal hair, wool or hides, particularly goat skins contaminated with soil. Spores can germinate outside an animal under appropriate conditions.
Dengue-like fever with headache, malaise, arthralgia or myalgia for about 2 to 5 days; occasionally nausea and vomiting, lower limb weakness, conjunctivitis, photophobia and a rash. The fever resolves in a few days; the disease is non-fatal.
By bite of an infected phlebotomine sandfly.
HIV was first recognized clinically in 1981. As of 2009, over 25 million people are estimated to have died from HIV and around 33 million people are living with HIV. HIV epidemics are categorized into ‘low-level’ (HIV prevalence <1% in the general population and <5% in vulnerable group such as MSM, injecting drug users, sex workers); ‘concentrated’ (HIV prevalence <1% in the general population but > 5% in at least one vulnerable group); and ‘generalized’ (HIV prevalence > 1% in the general population). The greatest burden of HIV continues to fall on Sub-Saharan Africa, with 68% of all people living with HIV and 72% of all HIV-related deaths in 2009. The epidemic in Africa is, however, heterogeneous, with high-prevalence generalized epidemics in Southern African countries; generalized but moderate prevalence epidemics in Central, East and West Africa, and low-level epidemics in North Africa. No countries in Asia have a generalized epidemic. HIV-1 can be divided in four groups (M, O, N, and P). Over 90% of HIV-1 infections are group M and the map opposite shows the distribution of the 9 subtypes (clades) and recombinants of the M group HIV-1 viruses.
Humans. Rotaviruses in animals are distinct from those causing disease in humans.
Each hantavirus has its specific rodent host. HPS is generally caused by the sigmodontine-borne hantaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that hantaviruses have a long co-evolutionary history with their host.
Wild rodents (gerbils) that live in burrows together with sandfly vector. Hyraxes for L. aethiopica.
Leishmania species, protozoa, members of the Trypanosomatidae family, order Kinetoplastida. Leishmania species that cause CL in the old world are: Leishmania major, L. tropica, and L. aethiopica. L. killicki is synonymous to L. tropica. L. infantum/chagasi and L. donovani can cause both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. L. chagasi is considered the same species as L. infantum, and are referred to as L. infantum/chagasi.
By tick bite; rarely by blood transfusion and transplacental/perinatal. Ticks must feed for more than 24 hours for transmission to occur.
Treatment of uncomplicated B. quintana bacteremia is with a macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin) or doxycyclin. In case of endocarditis 4–6 months of therapy is recommended in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin or gentamicin for the first 2–3 weeks. Heart valve replacement may be needed.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a Gram-positive, aerobic rod that is classified into three potentially toxigenic biotypes, intermedius, mitis, and gravis. Toxin producing strains of C. diphtheriae carry a bacteriophage-derived tox gene. Toxinproducing strains of C. ulcerans may also cause respiratory diphtheria.
The 17D live, attenuated vaccine is protective after 10 days; revaccination is recommended every 10 years. Anti-mosquito precautions. Prevent infected individuals from mosquito exposure to break the transmission cycle.
Female blackflies (Simulium). Transmission by S. damnosum complex in Africa is responsible for > 95% onchocerciasis cases. S. neavei complex in East Africa and S. rasyani in Yemen. In Latin America: Female blackflies (Simulium). Transmission by S. damnosum complex in Africa is responsible for > 95% onchocerciasis cases. S. neavei complex in East Africa and
Leptospira chronically colonize the proximal renal tubules of many animals and are excreted in the urine into the environment. Animals can shed Leptospira into the environment for prolonged periods without any signs of disease.
Bartonella quintana (formerly Rochalimaea quintana and Rickettsia quintana), a fastidious intracellular Gram-negative bacterium.
Among those infected, about 20% develop acute watery diarrhea, of which 10–20% develop severe watery diarrhea with vomiting, leading to severe dehydration which may be lethal if not treated. The CFR is typically below 5%, but in crowded refugee camps it can run as high as 50%.
Hookworm eggs hatch in the soil and develop to infective larvae (L3) that can penetrate the skin. After entering the host, the larvae migrate to the lungs, move up the trachea and swallowed. In the gastrointestinal tract the larvae mature to adult worms (both sexes). After mating, the female hookworms produce up to 30,000 eggs per day that are shedded with the stools into the environment.
The limits of P. falciparum malaria is determined by the presence of vector species and control measures within a certain region. P. falciparum malaria causes approximately 500 million cases each year and around one million deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2007 almost 60% of the 2.4 billion people at risk of malaria were living in areas with a stable risk of P. falciparum. High endemicity was most common and widespread in the African region. In the Americas, those at risk were all in the low endemicity class. In Asia 88% are in the low endemicity class, 11% in the intermediate class, and 1% in the high endemicity class. Recent progress is being made by the Global Malaria Action Plan to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality world wide and have a vision for malaria elimination. Ranking countries on the possibility of elimination shows that it is most feasible in the Americas and several countries in Asia and the west Pacific. It is least feasible in Africa, where much of west and central Africa need more than 90% reduction in transmission.
Onchocerca volvulus, a filarial nematode (roundworm). Adult female worm is approximately 50 cm long.
Polysaccharide vaccines against A, C, Y, and W135 are available. These vaccines are safe and effective in adults and older children but are poorly immunogenic in children under the age of 2 and the duration of protection is limited to 3–5 years. The development of a group C conjugated meningococcal vaccine that is effective in children under the age of 2 years has been an important advance, and conjugate vaccines are now available for A, C, Y, and W135. The development of a group B vaccine remains a challenge. Chemoprophylaxis of close contacts eradicates carriage and reduces the incidence of secondary cases. Vaccination of household contacts may also prevent further cases.
Humans. Cattle and other livestock may harbor C. ulcerans
Direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets.
Several serologic tests are available. Virus can be isolated or RNA detected in acute blood by RT-PCR.
Removal of breeding sites in any type of container that holds water (e.g. vase, tire). Larviciding standing water, adulticiding with non-persistent insecticides. Personal protection with suitable clothing, mosquito repellents, nets, and screens.
TB is a major cause of death and disability world wide, especially in developing countries. Morbidity and mortality rates increase with age, and are higher in males. In regions of high incidence, morbidity peaks in adults of working age. Morbidity is higher in urban populations, among the poor, and in closed institutions such as prisons and military barracks. There were an estimated 9.27 million incident cases of TB in the world in 2007 (14% HIV positive), an almost 50% increase from 1990, and an estimated onethird of the world’s population is either latently or actively infected with TB. Most of the cases in 2007 were in Asia (55%) and Africa (31%). MDR-TB is a serious problem in Russia, former Russian republics, India and China. In 2007 there were an estimated 0.5 million MDR-TB cases. By 2008, 55 countries reported at least one XDR-TB case.
Avoid exposure to feces of reservoir species wash hands, fruit and vegetables, periodically treat high-risk dogs, eliminate ownerless dogs. Praziquantel-containing baits have reduced infection in urban foxes and water voles in Switzerland and Germany. Eggs are highly sensitive to elevated temperatures and desiccation, but survive for months at freezing temperatures and are not affected by common disinfectants or ethanol.
Boutonneuse fever (group name for R.conorii infections: MSF, ISF, ITT), QTT and STT/NATT: mild febrile illness that may last up to 2 weeks, eschar at bite site with regional lymphadenopathy (in ISF, eschars are rare), generalized maculopapular erythematous rash on palms on soles after 4–5 days. The disease can be severe with a CFR up to 3%. ATBF is milder than other rickettsioses, fever and rash are less common, multiple eschars may be present with regional lymphadenopathy.
Repeated direct contact with infected secretions from infected individual (mainly from eye to nose); also by hands and fomites (shared clothes, towels, or bedlinen). Flies also play a role in the transmission. High risk of infection in close contacts of infected individuals.
Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and B. timori, threadlike nematode worms 80 to 100 mm long (W. bancrofti), or 43 to 55 mm long (B. malayi).
Brucella melitensis, B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis, intracellular Gram-negative bacilli.
By mosquito bite (Anopheles spp.). Transmission has been described in needle sharing IVDUs and through blood transfusion.
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an enveloped, spherical, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae. Epizootic or epidemic VEE viruses belong to subtypes IAB and IC. Enzootic VEE complex viruses belong to subtypes II to VI and ID, IE, and IF.With the exception of IE strains, these do not cause disease in equids, but can cause sporadic disease in humans. VEEV is considered a potential biological warfare agent.
Wear clothes that cover extremities; cover skin lesions; insect repellent; cover water supply.
N. meningitidis is transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets.
Rodent-to-rodent though saliva, excreta and bite, with humans as an accidental, dead-end host.
Ingested E. histolytica non-motile cysts will excyst in the gastrointestinal tract and develop to motile trophozoites that can penetrate the gut mucosa. In the colon, the trophozoites encyst and the cysts are excreted with the feces.
Systemic treatment to prevent dissemination with pentavalent antimonials. Depending on the infecting Leishmania species, alternative systemic treatment can be administered with: amphotericin B, pentamidine, or miltefosine. Topical treatment options are: paramomycin, ketoconazole, and thermotherapy.
Lockjaw.
Mainly humans; yaws is also found in non-human primates (baboons, chimpanzees, and gorillas).
Vector control; mosquito repellent; insecticidetreated bed nets; residual spraying of insecticides; treatment of infected humans. Recently control measures are being upscaled in a malaria elimination effort. Morocco, United Arab Emirates, and Turkmenistan have been certified malaria free by WHO.
Pestis, pest, bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, black plague, black death.
Blastomycosis is a sporadic disease with a worldwide distribution, though most cases are reported from North America. It is endemic in the Mississippi and Ohio river basins and around the Great Lakes. In endemic areas blastomycosis is frequent in dogs but rare in cats and other animals. The annual incidence of blastomycosis in northern Wisconsin is estimated to be 40–100 per 100,000 in humans and 1,400 per 100,000 in dogs. In the USA outbreaks are usually seen in the spring and fall, indicating infection 1–3 months earlier. Cases are commoner in males and the disease is rare in children. Blastomycosis occurs close to rivers and lakes with changing water levels. Activities involving shores or waterways, like fishing and canoeing, are identified as risk factors for infection.
Measles has a worldwide distribution, but is eliminated from the western hemisphere through vaccination. Measles deaths world wide fell by 78% from an estimated 733,000 in 2000 to 164,000 in 2008; all regions but one have achieved the United Nations goal of reducing measles mortality by 90%, however, it remains the leading cause of vaccinepreventable deaths in children and there are fears of a resurgence if vaccination falters for lack of resources. WHO figures for 2008 were 282,000 reported cases, with many thousands more unreported. Some 58% of countries have 90% or more vaccine coverage, adequate to stop transmission, but endemic countries have case fatality rates of up to 30% in places. Most measles deaths ( > 95%) occur in countries with a per capita income of <US$ 1,000. Measles-free countries still have imported cases and limited outbreaks in subpopulations with low or no vaccination coverage (e.g. religious communities). Measles is being considered for global elimination or even eradication.
Mycobacterium ulcerans, an acid-fast, slow-growing bacillus. There are at least four geographically distinct strains: African, American, Asian, and Australian. They all produce mycolactone, which destroys tissue and suppresses the immune system. Variations in the structure of mycolactone may correlate with disease severity in different regions.
Self-limiting conjunctivitis, including watery or mucopurulent discharge. Typical findings are lymphoid follicles and papillary hypertrophy. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the conjunctiva and trichiasis. Trichiasis damages the corneal surface, resulting in keratitis, vascularization of the cornea, and impaired defence against secondary bacterial and fungal infection. Corneal damage produces corneal scar, leading to blindness.
Dipstick test, dark-field or phase microscopy on fecal or rectal swab smear; bacterial culture.
vCJD is characterized by a relatively early age of onset (28 years) and prominent early psychiatric symptoms: anxiety, depression, agitation, delusions, and unpleasant sensory symptoms. Neurological features are: unsteadiness, difficulty walking, and involuntary movements. Memory loss progresses to severe cognitive impairment and, at the time of death, patients have become unable to move or speak. The median duration of illness is 14 months.
Ticks introduce Babesia spp. sporozoites from the ticks’ salivary glands into small mammals/humans during feeding. The sporozoites infect erythrocytes in which they asexually reproduce by budding and develop through various stages into gametocytes. Ticks can take up circulating gametocytes during feeding on an infected animal. The gametocytes fertilize in the tick gut and develop into sporozoites in their salivary glands.
The disease ecology is not completely understood. Humans are likely dead end hosts.
Protection from vector bites by wearing permethrin-treated light-colored clothes and fly repellent on exposed skin. DEC can be used as prophylaxis, but should not be used routinely.
Detection of toxin in serum, stool or wound by mouse inoculation or ELISA; culture of the bacterium from stool or wound; electromyography.
Serology to detect specific IgM antibodies; RT-PCR to detect viral RNA in blood or stool.
Rubella specific IgM or significant rise in antibody titer in paired samples; RT-PCR or virus isolation from throat swab, or other specimens in CRS.
Clean wounds, perform debridement and remove foreign objects. A one-off dose of im or iv human tetanus immunoglobulin removes unbound toxin but does not affect bound toxin. Metronidazole in large doses for 7–14 days to eradicate C. tetani infection. Since the effect of bound toxin may last for 4–6 weeks, prolonged supportive care is required. Tetanus does not induce immunity. Vaccination with tetanus toxoid is therefore indicated during treatment.
Hib is transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets or direct contact with respiratory secretions.
Infection control hospitals; safe injection practices by healthcare providers; screening of blood products; clean needle programs. HCV immunoglobulin is not effective. There is no vaccine.
Brucella spp. is introduced into animals via inhalation, broken skin, or mucosa and invades local lymph nodes where it propagates and enters the bloodstream and disseminates to mainly the reticulo-endothelial system (bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes), kidneys and placenta in pregnant animals. From infected organs, like mammary glands, kidneys, and placenta, viable bacteria are shedded into the environment by milk, urine, and uterine discharge, leading to new infections in exposed animals and humans.
Rodents, voles (B. microti), cattle (B. divergens), lagomorphs (B.divergens-like), possibly horses (B. duncani, formerly type WA1), or sheep (Babesia type KO1).
By tsetse fly bite (day biters); blood transfusion, and congenital.
The impact of sanitation, footwear, and health education is minimal. To reduce the disease burden of STHs, mass treatment campaigns with benzimidazoles and praziquantel are undertaken, and sanitation and access to clean water improved. As most STHs occur in children, control efforts are targeted at schools. Infective larvae can survive in soil for several months.
Rats (Rattus, particularly R. norvegicus and Bandicotta spp.). Infected dogs, wild mammals, and marsupials have been found, but do not contribute to the spread of the disease.
By mosquito bite. There is no person-toperson transmission.
Fecal–oral route, mainly via fecally contaminated water, but also via: food, materno-fetal, and transfusion of blood products. Direct person-to-person transmission is uncommon. Cycle: Human to human and occasionally animal to human. HEV is excreted from the liver into the stool via the bile and eventually into the environment. The amount of infectious virus in the stool is relatively low and explains a lower rate of transmission as compared to hepatitis A (see Hepatitis A map).
Chikungunya means ‘that which bends up’ in Makonde language, to describe the pain.
Usually asymptomatic or mild. Diarrhea alternating with constipation, vomiting and anorexia, edema of the face, abdominal wall and legs, ascites. Heavy worm loads may cause bowel obstruction. Eosinophilia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and secondary anemia may occur.
Humans.
HBV disease has an acute and chronic form. 10% of children and 30–50% of adults present with symptoms of acute HBV infection similar to hepatitis A and last several weeks: fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, jaundice, dark urine, and light stools. Fever is often absent and arthritis and rash may be present. Chronic disease evolves to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma and eventually death. 90% of infants who are infected in their first year develop chronic infection. Only 10% of adults who acquire infection develop chronic disease, as the majority is able to clear HBV within 6 months. Differences in disease severity, risk of liver cirrhosis and development of hepatocellular carcinoma are seen by age of infection, level of viral replication, level of inflammation, region and HBV genotype. Also co-infection with HDV leads to more severe chronic liver disease.
Enteric fever, typhus abdominalis.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, including M. tuberculosis, M. africanum, M. canetti, and M. bovis, slow growing acid-fast rods. M. bovis is not discussed further.
Monkeys, possibly rodents.
Microscopy of stained smear from a bubo, sputum or CSF shows characteristic ‘safety-pin’ shape; serology (IFA; ELISA); rapid dipstick test. Culture takes about 4 days.
Monkey–mosquito–monkey; P. knowlesi has a short (24-hour) asexual lifeycle; humans are incidental hosts.
Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1), a type C retrovirus with at least 6 subtypes. The virus was isolated for the first time in the USA in 1980, before HIV-1 (also a retrovirus) was discovered in 1983. Genomically, simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) isolates cluster closely with HTLV-1 in the same region, suggesting simian-to-human transmission at multiple occasions.
Rodent to rodent with spill over to humans in case of adequate exposure.
Respiratory droplets from people with respiratory diptheria, or from asyumptomatic throat or nasal carriers. Direct contact with discharge from the skin of cutaneous diphteria cases. People recovering from diphtheria may carry the organism in the nasopharynx for weeks. Rarely from contaminated items. In the past, outbreaks have been linked to consumption of contaminated raw milk.
Direct transmission via skin to skin or oral contact (also via sharing drinking and eating utensils). Sharing of drinking vessels plays an important role in transmission of endemic syphilis in arid regions. There is little or no mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy.
Most infections produce few or no symptoms. Acute symptoms include variable fever, lymphadenopathy,malaise, and hepatosplenomegaly. The entry site may be inflamed for up to 8 weeks, and a diagnostic unilateral bipalpebral edema (Romana’s sign) appears in a few cases. After a latent period which may last 10–30 years, chronic irreversible sequelae occur in 20–30% of cases: myocardial lesions with arrhythmia, often fatal, andlesions of the esophagus, colon, and peripheral nervous system. Variations in clinical presentations can be related to the strain involved. Group I T. cruzi, rare north of the Amazon region, produce cardiac but not digestive tract lesions. Group IIT. cruzi can produce both cardiac and digestive tract lesions. AIDS patients may develop meningoencephalopathy. CFR from encephalomyelitis or cardiac failure among untreated symptomatic patients is 5–10%.
There are two different groups of etiologic agents: fungi and bacteria. Fungal mycetoma is called eumycetoma, and at least 34 fungal species have been implicated. The fungi Madurella mycetomatis and Pseudallescheria boydii are the most common fungal causative agents of eumycetoma. Bacterial mycetoma is called actinomycetoma and at least 14 actinomycetes have been implicated, of which the bacterial species of Nocardia, Streptomyces and Actinomadura are the most common causative agents of actinomycetoma.
For mild cases, an oral triazole; for severe cases, amphotericin B followed by an oral triazole for at least a year.
90% of the cases will be self-limited and asymptomatic; 10% develop invasive-intestinal disease (colitis), and <1% extra-intestinal disease (liver abscess). Amebic colitis presents with abdominal cramps, weight loss, and watery or sometimes bloody diarrhea; most patients are afebrile. Amebic colitis rarely progresses to necrotizing colitis, ameboma, and toxic megacolon. Amebic colitis affects children and adults equally, but mainly males. Amebic liver-abscess mainly occurs in men aged 18 to 50 years, for unknown reasons. E. moshkovskii can cause non-invasive diarrhea.
Person-to-person via inhalation of infectious aerosols from cases with pulmonary TB, particularly after prolonged exposure over time. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is generally not communicable. HIV-infected individuals are more likely to develop TB.
Bite of infected larval mites (chiggers). There is no direct person-to-person transmission.
Humans are the main reservoir. S. haematobium can infect primates, livestock and rodents. S. mansoni, S. intercalatum, and S. guineensis can infect rodents.
Blister,usually on the leg or foot,which burns or itches, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, dizziness and generalized urticaria. Multiple and repeat infections occur, there is no protective immunity. Painful and infected ulcers can incapacitate patients for months. Secondary bacterial infection can lead to abscesses, synovitis, ankylosis andlimbcontractures, septic arthritis, and life-threatening sepsis.
Praziquantel; the cure rate for O. viverrini is over 90%.
Supportive measures such as mechanical ventilation. There is no specific treatment, but ribavirin may have some effect. Monoclonal antibodies as post-exposure prophylaxis before onset of clinical signs.
Microscopy for eggs, larvae and/or adult worms in the stool, or in intestinal biopsies for C. philippinensis (eggs resemble those of Trichuris trichiura).
Valley fever, San Joaquin fever, Desert fever, Desert rheumatism, California disease.
RMSF and R. parkeri rickettsiosis are characterized by fever, myalgia, malaise, headache, and a maculopapular eruption that can involve the palms or soles. R. parkeri rickettsiosis is milder than RMSF, and often does not require hospitalization. RMSF cases may progress and develop stupor, delirium, ataxia, or coma; RMSF CFR is about 7%. Untreated RMSF is often progressive with a CFR of 20%, which is not the case for untreated R. parkeri rickettsiosis. Most ( > 90%) R. parkeri cases have an eschar, which is rare in RMSF. GI symptoms are common in RMSF and rare in R. parkeri disease.
During outbreaks: strict control on animal movements and slaughtering; health education of everyone who butchers, prepares, and cooks pork, including in their homes; wearing gloves to handle raw or uncooked pork, careful washing of hands and utensils. Adequate cooking essential; WHO recommends cooking pork to reach an internal temperature of 70 C, or until the juices are clear rather than pink.
During bloodmeal, the sandfly ingests infected blood with amastigotes. The amastigotes develop to motile promastigotes that multiply in the sandfly gut, and finally motile promastigotes travel to the mouth parts and are injected into another host during feeding. In the host cell the promastigotes develop into amastigotes.
Soil with high nitrogen content, particularly areas with a lot of bird or bat guano, like barns and caves. Blackbird roosts can also be heavily contaminated. Unlike bats, birds are not infected by H. capsulatum and do not excrete the fungus in their droppings. Bird droppings are considered a nutrient source for fungal growth in the already contaminated soil.
Hard ticks (Ixodidae). Depending on the tick species, they can acquire infection via feeding on animals with rickettsemia, or via venereal, transovarial, and trans-stadial passage. Animals preferred for feeding varies by tick species and their life stage.Rodent hosts include ground squirrels, mice, and voles.
Salmonella enterica enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi), a Gram-negative bacillus. S. Typhi belongs to Salmonella serogroup D and possesses somatic antigen O9, a single flagellar antigen Hd, and virulence antigen Vi. S. Paratyphi A can cause similar disease.
Visualizing characteristic eggs in feces or duodenal fluid by microscopy.
By mosquito bite (Anopheles spp.).
Supportive, there is no specific treatment.
Immunocompromised, asplenic, and elderly people are at higher risk of symptomatic disease. The number of cases diagnosed in the USA has increased markedly since 1975 due to an increase in the white-tailed deer population, hosts of the adult vector ticks. Nearly all patients with Babesia divergens infection in Europe had been splenectomized and exposed to cattle. The B. divergens-like parasite in the USA has a reservoir in cottontail rabbits, and is not infectious for cattle; it has been found in only 3 patients. All 3 patients with B. venatorum (EU1) infection had also been splenectomized. Cape Verdean, Egyptian, and Asian cases lie outside the range of Ixodes ricinus; B. duncani and B. divergens-like cases in west coast states of USA lie outside the range of I. scapularis. Possible vectors for these cases are I. dentatus in the central USA, and I. pacificus on the west coast. Infection is seasonal (summer), coinciding with abundance of nymphal ticks in warmer months.
Microfilariae in human blood are ingested by a vector mosquito, and develop in 2 weeks into larvae that enter the mouth-parts. Larvae are deposited onto the skin and invade through the wound made at the next mosquito feed. In humans, they travel via thelymphatics, when adults they form ‘nests’ and produce microfilariae, which migrate to the blood and display periodicity coinciding with the peak vector biting times.
Virus isolation in cell culture; RT-PCR; antigen detection; serology by IgM ELISA. The virus is a BSL-4 agent.
South American blastomycosis, Brazilian blastomycosis, Lutz–Splendore–Almeida disease.
Anti-mosquito measures: light-colored clothing with long sleeves mosquito repellents containing DEET on exposed skin, avoid as much as possible outdoor activities at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active, and removal of mosquito-breeding sites from around the home.
Serology (IF, EIA); PCR; culture in mice or cell lines.
Vaccination of livestock and humans with occupational risk in endemic areas. Antibiotic prophylaxis when exposed and vaccination in case of inhalation anthrax. Infected animal carcases should be burned or deeply buried, preferably at the site of death.
Most infections with S. stercoralis are asymptomatic. Symptoms may include: upper abdominal pain; cough; diarrhea; a red and painful, creeping urticarial eruption on the skin; and vomiting. Pulmonary symptoms (including Loeffler syndrome) can occur. Disseminated strongyloidiasis occurs in immunocompromised patients and presents with abdominal pain, distension, shock, pulmonary and neurologic complications, and septicemia. High mortality rates (15–87%) have been described in patients with disseminated disease.
Humans; forest monkeys in West Africa and Southeast Asia.
RT-PCR on whole blood or serum; virus isolation; plaque reduction neutralization test (there is crossreactivity with related viruses, including CHIKV).
Supportive.
Similar to syphilis, the clinical manifestations can be classified into early and late stages. Early-stage lesions are generally infectious and may last up to 5 years, with periods of latency. The disease has a relapsing clinical course with mainly skin manifestations, which is the only finding in pinta. In yaws and endemic syphilis there is also involvement of the mucous membranes and the bones. Cardiovascular and neurological lesions are extremely rare.
Alveolar or multilocular echinococcosis.
Eggs are passed in feces into freshwater bodies, mature in about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on water temperature, and hatch ciliated larvae (coracidia). Coracidia develop into procercoid larvae after ingestion by freshwater crustaceans (copepods). The copepods are eaten by a second intermediate host, typically small fish. The larvae migrate into the musculature where they develop into the human infectious plerocercoid larvae. Larger predator fish (e.g. pike, burbot, perch) ingest the smaller infected fish upon which the plerocercoid larvae migrate to the flesh of these larger fish that serve as third intermediate hosts harboring larvae. Humans and larger mammals acquire the disease by eating these larger fish raw or undercooked. The larvae mature into adult tapeworms that attach to the small intestinal wall by scolex and develop eggfilled proglottids that detach. Up to 1 million eggs per day per worm are passed in the feces, 2–6 weeks after infection.
SARS presents initially with fever, headache, myalgia, and a non-productive cough that may progress to dyspnoea with pulmonary infiltrations on chest x-ray. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present in early SARS illness. Case fatality is around 10%, and is higher in older adults than in children and young adults.
Direct examination of blood smear (low sensitivity), PCR, serology (indirect immunofluorescence, indirect hemagglutination). Serology can give false positive results. Culture takes weeks.
In the early 20th century diphtheria was the leading cause of death in children aged 4–10 years in Europe, and many countries experienced large diphtheria outbreaks during World War II. Childhood vaccination has now virtually eliminated diphtheria as a public health problem in most developed countries, and diphtheria cases reported to WHO have fallen by almost 93% between 1980 and 2008. The WHO has estimated that around 5,000 deaths from diphtheria occurred in 2004, with 4,000 of these in children under 5 years of age. However, a steady decline in the global number of reported diphtheria cases from 1980 was interrupted by a large recrudescence in the early to mid-1990s in the former Soviet Union. Since 1990, diphtheria outbreaks have also occurred in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and South America. Without periodic immunological boosting through vaccination or natural exposure to toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae, adults may become susceptible to infection. Epidemics may then occur, exacerbated by poor living conditions or the emergence of new toxigenic variants. This has led to the introduction of booster doses of toxoid in adolescents in some non-endemic countries.
Virus detection in blood or tissue by culture or RT-PCR; serology (IgM ELISA, IFA). Virus isolation should be done in a BSL-4 laboratory.
Undulant fever, malta fever, Mediterranean fever.
German measles
Virus detection by RT-PCR of respiratory specimens is recommended; virus culture requires a BSL-3 facility. Microneutralization assay is recommended to detect antibodies to A/H5N1. Rapid antigen tests are not recommended due to lack of sensitivity.
Screening blood and blood products before use, bottle-feeding (20% of breast-fed infants of infected mothers become infected), using condoms. Counseling and education of IVDUs to implement harm reduction practices.
E. histolytica is distributed world wide, especially in countries with poor sanitation and little access to clean water (see Water and Sanitation maps). It is estimated that E. histolytica is responsible for 40,000 to 100,000 deaths per year. Most prevalence studies in the past did not distinguish between E. histolytica and the non-pathogenic E. dispar, and therefore little is known of the current disease prevalence of the pathogenic E. histolytica. E. histolytica infection is endemic in Mexico, India, South Africa, some Central and South American countries, and Asian Pacific countries. Community-based studies in urban slums in Bangladesh showed that: 9% of preschool children suffer from amebic diarrhea each year, with 2% requiring a hospital visit. In developed countries, amebiasis is seen in travelers and immigrants from developing countries, and cases may also be found in closed psychiatric institutions. MSM are also a risk group, since they are more exposed.
Avoid eating raw slugs, snails, other molluscs, freshwater prawns, land crabs, and uncooked vegetables grown in ponds (e.g. watercress) from endemic areas.Washing of vegetables does not guarantee absence from larval contamination. Boil snails and crustaceans for 5 minutes or freeze at 15 C for 24 hours.
Gram stain and culture of CSF, blood, or synovial fluid. Capsular polysaccharide antigen detection by latex agglutination or other techniques. PCR from normally sterile site.
A zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii, an intracellular Gram-negative bacterium, and is closely related to Legionella spp., Francisella tularensis, and Rickettsia spp. C. burnetii is classified as a potential biological warfare agent.
O. viverrini: usually asymptomatic. Occasionally abdominal pain, flatulence, fatigue, mild hepatomegaly, jaundice, and cholangitis. Cholangiocarcinoma is the most serious complication. O. felineus: fever and hepatitis-like symptoms in the acute stage (right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis). Chronic symptoms: biliary tract obstruction, inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tract, liver abscesses, pancreatitis, and suppurative cholangitis.
Hantaviruses, a large group of different, enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense viruses with a tripartite RNA genome, that belong to the Bunyaviridae family. Hantaviruses are named after the Hantan River area in South Korea, where the first hantavirus (Hantaan) was isolated in the 1970s. Old World and New World hantaviruses share high similarity in their genome and have comparable life cycles. Currently, there is no consensus on the classification of hantaviruses. Old World hantaviruses shown on the map are: Dobrava–Belgrade virus (DOBV), Hantaan virus (HTNV), Puumula virus (PUUV), and Saaremaa virus (SAAV). Seoul virus (SEOV) is not shown, it is world wide in major port cities.
Mainly Ochlerotatus vigilax and Culex annulirostris. Aedes camptorhynchus, A. normanensis, A. notoscriptus, and Coquillettidia linealis are vectors in some circumstances.
Hemorrhagic fever, jungle yellow fever, urban yellow fever.
Infections are often mild, with more severe neurologic disease in 4–14% of the cases that may progress to death. VEEV infection often presents like an influenza-like illness. Severe encephalitis is less common in adults as compared to children. Absence of a rash distinguishes it from dengue and Mayaro fevers. About 30% of survivors have neurological sequelae. CFR for VEE is <1%. VEEV infection may cause stillbirths.
Zika virus, an enveloped RNA flavivirus; closely related to Spondweni virus.
Ziehl–Neelsen stain on smears or biopsies, culture (takes 6–12 weeks), PCR, histopathology.
Serology (HEV IgM, IgG); HEV RNA detection in blood and stool by RT-PCR.
Secondary prophylaxis with itraconazole. HIV patients with low CD4 counts should avoid endemic areas.
Repeated re-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis serovars A, B, Ba, and C, an obligate intracellular bacterium. The genital serovars D to K can infect the conjunctiva, but generally do not lead to blindness as they cause self-limited infections that typically do not recur.
Loa loa filariasis, loiasis, African eyeworm, Calabar swelling
Fever and signs of meningitis (headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, intolerance of light, and decreased level of consciousness). Hearing loss, generally permanent, in around 50% of those infected. Arthritis, pneumonia, and fatal toxic shock syndrome are possible complications.
Detection of viral RNA in blood by RTPCR; serology (IgM ELISA); virus culture.
Streptomycin is recommended, with gentamicin as an alternative. Tetracyclines may be used for less severe cases.
Group A rotaviruses have been established as the single most important cause of severe acute gastroenteritis in young children in developed and developing nations. Rotavirus is estimated to cause 138 million diarrheal episodes per year with 2 million requiring hospitalization and 440,000 deaths in children of <5 years. The incidence of rotavirus disease is similar in developed and developing countries, but deaths mainly occur in poverty stricken nations due to poor health infrastructure. Control is likely not achieved by improvements in clean water access, hygiene, and sanitation. Rotavirus vaccines are recommended to prevent severe and fatal rotavirus disease. For vaccine introduction, knowledge of the regional circulating rotavirus serotypes is needed. The epidemiology of rotavirus serotypes has substantial temporal and geographic variability and multiple serotypes may cocirculate within the same region and fluctuates each year within the same region. The 5 most common rotavirus serotypes (G1–G4 and G9) were responsible for approximately 95% of infections world wide with G1[P8] responsible for more than 70% of infections in North America, Australia, and Europe but only 30% of infections in South America, Asia, and Africa.
Female phlebotomine sandflies (Lutzomyia spp.).
Ticks of the genera Amblyomma and Ixodes.
Lyme disease is a clinical diagnosis and laboratory testing is supportive. ELISA or IFA, confirmed by IgM and IgG Western or striped blot test. PCR on blood, CSF, urine and tissues, but is not standardized.
